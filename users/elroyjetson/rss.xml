			<description>@shanselman aka Superman  is undeniably a remarkable speaker. He is able to take the most mundane thing, like migrating his blog to the cloud, and spin it into a 55 minute journey during which you get a full semester of computer science training and didn't even know it.&#10;&#10;But he is teaching so much more than what he is talking about. Observe his intimate knowledge of his chosen OS and how he uses it's features to be productive. Ignore what he is saying and just watch him use the computer. That alone is worth your time.&#10;&#10;On another level, he gives you a lesson in how to be a good human being. His talks are remarkable and every one is pure gold.  https://t.co/NjF4YlM4Mt&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Too bad Windows Phone failed.  I still believe it had the best user experience and such a fresh design. https://t.co/OfIwv3ltyY&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@wincent I often try to migrate to Apple Numbers, which is a really nice application when you understand it, but the features of Google Sheets just keep me going back. The ability to work on it from any platform and share it with anyone is too compelling.&#10;&#10;</description>
