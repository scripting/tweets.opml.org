			<description>&lt;p&gt;@BombasticDave @dlbno Of course. I also have no knowledge of or plans to, nor a desire to, implement a single misfortune, much less 6 misfortunes. All I’m stating are the odds of them happening, no more, no less.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@dlbno For that to happen, the Royal Family would have to fall victim to 6 separate misfortunes and would be unable to reign. But that will never happen. 3 misfortunes? That’s possible. 5 misfortunes? There’s an outside chance. But 6 misfortunes? I’d like to see that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The second part of the UK TV series House of Cards imagines a strained relationship between the prime minister and an activist King (a very thinly veiled version of then-Prince Charles) after the Queen dies. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lwZjEcB1D1&quot;&gt;https://t.co/lwZjEcB1D1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;You might very well think that House of Cards (UK) is better than the American version of the show, but I couldn’t possibly comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I went to bed last night angry and sad about how unfair it was that I didn’t get to see my mother for over a year and a half before she died, but glad at all the time I had to talk with her up until the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, if you need me to be angry and sad about something, it’ll have to compete with that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@BovyMaltz It’s true, you never do actually see Her Majesty in Yes Minister/Yes, Prime Minister.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(Aside: Staying up late to watch it on YTV was the reason I only ever saw the last half of episodes of Keeping Up Appearances.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Overhearing a conversation where a guy introduced himself to a woman, he says he likes her shirt, and they’re talking about the concert she’s going to. Now he’s deciding whether he should go to the concert now. That’s how it happens, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;They’re still talking about music and TV shows, and they haven’t gotten to the “values conversation” yet, so I can’t tell how their relationship will progress beyond sharing what popular culture they enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just listened to three hours of Godspeed You! Black Emperor. You’re welcome for telling you.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I once went to their concert to see the opening act, and evidently GY!BE fans are fairly legendary for being quiet during a show. I didn’t stay for them, so I’m trying to see what the fuss is all about.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Or, I dunno, maybe I’m just sad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bluegriff @domesticat It still feels fraught with peril. I have to test the timestamp sharing link each time before sharing, because who knows what changes with inline previews since the last time I shared it? And then there’s the end of the video where it references the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;My handsome heroism last night at the Wu-Tang Clan concert was to zip up the backpack of a quite intoxicated woman. (I wonder how long she went with it open. It takes Torontonians a really long time to point something like that out.) I got a friendly pat on the shoulder for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
