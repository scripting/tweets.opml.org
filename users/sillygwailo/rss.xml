			<description>Somebody picked up a half a garbage bag worth of litter at a Toronto park this evening and people are talking about it. https://t.co/cOoSIq4cnZ&#10;&#10;Just kidding, it was me. People really were talking about it, though. I‚Äôd rather the City do it, which is what I said to anybody who came up to me and thanked me.&#10;&#10;I left the dead bird on the ground because I figured that one was God‚Äôs plan.&#10;&#10;üé∂ ‚ÄúI feel good, sometimes I don‚Äôt, aay!‚Äù üé∂ https://t.co/0nVG5lXma0&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I made my first Sloane Peterson sighting of the summer today, 21 days in.&#10;&#10;So begins what I expect is a Sloane Peterson Cluster Phenomenon, which is where, if you see one woman who looks like Sloane Peterson, you start seeing them everywhere for a few days, then none for two weeks.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I‚Äôm normally against trees on sidewalks (they effectively halve the width of them) but I love these ones. These ones are part of the bike lane barrier! It annoys me that the electrical poles are still where they are, though. https://t.co/RHO3MxzHJ9&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Is it weird that the security guard and painters in my building aren‚Äôt wearing masks when there‚Äôs still a disease that we can get even if vaccinated, which shreds our lungs and causes permanent brain damage, that we‚Äôll get over and over until it ultimately kills us?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@davewiner My last memory of hitchhiking was when a buddy of mine and I needed a ride into town from his house (we were teens and almost the legal age to drive). The guy who picked us up talked about the pie he baked for a lady friend of his, in the hopes that he‚Äôd get some pie in return.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This looks similar to Toronto‚Äôs Queens Quay which, I contend, is a mess in a few places. https://t.co/b0TIZFpVGk&#10;&#10;You know what I did see at Queens Quay that I don‚Äôt see anywhere else in Toronto? A City employee picking up litter.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I‚Äôm going to Mississauga today by GO Transit. Cool, right?&#10;&#10;It was smooth sailing (on a train and then a bus) until I got to my stop, which Google Maps said was Financial Dr. and Derry Rd, but the GO Transit stop is labelled as Syntex Crt., a block away. Good thing I was paying attention!&#10;&#10;This plant near Financial Dr. and Syntex Crt. is right on a microconfluence. https://t.co/MXVv67HcT4&#10;&#10;The trip to Mississauga and back took 5 hours (including an hour of waiting since I got there early), to do one thing, and exchange, and it was exhausting. Of course I forgot a part of the thing I was exchanging, but the lady had compassion for me and said don‚Äôt worry about it.&#10;&#10;(I‚Äôm still going to mail the company the part, or sell it, or something, since I don‚Äôt have a use for it.)&#10;&#10;She assumed I drove there, because the whole built environment in that area assumes driving. I got the sense that a women on her break either laughed at me or took pity on me for walking there.&#10;&#10;It was pleasant riding the train and the bus to get there and back, I‚Äôll give GO Transit that. It reminded me of my train/bus trips to America from B.C. It gave me the idea that maybe that‚Äôs how I go to the USA the next time, whenever that is.&#10;&#10;Was it weird that there was a sign on the door that said, due to the disease that we can get even if vaccinated, which shreds our lungs and causes permanent brain damage, that we‚Äôll get over and over until it ultimately kills us, I had to call to be let in, but nobody picked up?&#10;&#10;Was it weird that there was a sign on the door that said, due to the disease that we can get even if vaccinated, which shreds our lungs and causes permanent brain damage, that we‚Äôll get over and over until it ultimately kills us, everybody had to wear a mask, but no staff did?&#10;&#10;Was it weird that, even though there‚Äôs a disease that we can get even if vaccinated, which shreds our lungs and causes permanent brain damage, that we‚Äôll get over and over until it ultimately kills us, the lady coughed on the item I was receiving and she didn‚Äôt sanitize it?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@cqwww Box breathing is the easiest breathing exercise for me to remember how to do.&#10;Separately: Counting each breath has been the easiest way for me to keep the focus on it. If I get distracted, I just start the count again.&#10;(I have a Headspace subscription as a perk from work.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli What‚Äôs an example of something that‚Äôs not working? Not because I think I have a solution, but because I have the same combo and maybe I‚Äôm missing something (that is, maybe I got used to something and there‚Äôs a better way to live).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@CanBball GLOBL JAM felt a bit too expensive to attend live this year, but I hope you hold it again next year. It was fun to watch on TV, and if any of the games take place in the Toronto/Hamilton area next year, I‚Äôll go in person. #GLOBLJAM https://t.co/dOO7MkbJhl&#10;&#10;@CanBball Any chance of introducing the Elam Ending to the rules for GLOBL JAM next year? It would mean no more backcourt fouls and no rushed possessions at the end of the game. #GLOBLJAM&#10;&#10;</description>
