			<description>It’s going ahead, though the way I phrased it at @CanadaPlanner, it could have been interpreted to mean His Holiness was coming to Canada. (Something I might have believed for a while.) When I wrote it, I consulted this guide, which explains my phrasing. https://t.co/t22HowUZh5&#10;&#10;The Winnipeg Free Press has a section for its coverage of Pope Francis visiting Indigenous delegates travelling to the Vatican from Canada. https://t.co/Syn7hG5mlw&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@gaminginthewild For problems like this (too many good things to choose from, too little time), I put things in a list and let a random picker make the choice for me. It was my attempt to combat decision fatigue, plus remove regret from the equation.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I bought this since I’d be sitting in that level anyway, and going alone anyway, and my seat is randomly assigned, which I can get behind because it means I don’t have to decide on where to sit (I hate deciding anything). https://t.co/S3d5YSJe0m&#10;&#10;I won’t be going to all 11 games. More like 4 of them. But I’ll get a foot-long hot dog at each of them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@PortmanDoe I wish there was a gesture for “You’ve had two years to figure this out” that’s subtle enough for that person to not come over and punch me in the face, but I don’t think there is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@geerlingguy It’s a service to log (“scrobble”) and list the music one plays. That is, if I play a song, the fact that I played a song shows up on my profile. It’s probably someone who watched your videos using Chrome. There’s an extension that “detects” music played on YT and “scrobbles” it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Non-Binding Tentative Deal Twitter is blowing up tonight!&#10;&#10;Non-binding tentative deal.&#10;&#10;Non-binding tentative deal.&#10;&#10;Non-binding tentative deal.&#10;&#10;NON-BINDING.&#10;&#10;TENTATIVE DEAL!&#10;&#10;The only Twitter that loves non-binding tentative deals more than Politics Twitter is Sports Twitter.&#10;&#10;The only Twitter that loves non-binding tentative deals more than Politics Twitter is Sports Twitter.&#10;&#10;They meant left-leaning, which is also funny. https://t.co/pVuTyAOvJG&#10;&#10;“Trudeau will be prime minister until 2025” which, OK, but do we even know what will happen this year, much less 3 years from now?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli Oh, that’s a great amount of time to spend there. I’m not much of a car driver, but having access to one on my last trip there was essential.&#10;Have you heard the it’s-funny-because-it’s-true joke that you should be prepared for three types of weather at all times?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli I’d love to hear about the trip during and afterwards. I assume you’ll do what I joke are the legally required tourist things, like tour the Golden Circle and go to the Blue Lagoon? Iceland’s tourist authorities will demand proof you’ve done those things.&#10;OK, no they won’t.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Now that almost all of the COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted in Ontario, never to return, since the pandemic is over, I still only have weak explanations about the strong reactions against them.&#10;&#10;The weak explanation I had about the “stop living in fear, live your life!” people was that they themselves lacked a fear response to basically anything. But that’s a brain disorder, and a rare one.&#10;&#10;The weak explanation I had about the people who complained that they couldn’t go to a restaurant or attend a party was that these were ecstatic experiences and that preventing them from having those experiences amounted to torture. But is dining out or partying that awesome?&#10;&#10;The weak explanation I had for people who protested against COVID-19 restrictions was that they didn’t actually believe in anything other than getting on TV. Going viral online was acceptable, with getting on the TV news being the ultimate goal for them. But was it?&#10;&#10;</description>
