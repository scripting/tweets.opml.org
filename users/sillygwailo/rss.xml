			<description>@geerlingguy It’s a service to log (“scrobble”) and list the music one plays. That is, if I play a song, the fact that I played a song shows up on my profile. It’s probably someone who watched your videos using Chrome. There’s an extension that “detects” music played on YT and “scrobbles” it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Non-Binding Tentative Deal Twitter is blowing up tonight!&#10;&#10;Non-binding tentative deal.&#10;&#10;Non-binding tentative deal.&#10;&#10;Non-binding tentative deal.&#10;&#10;NON-BINDING.&#10;&#10;TENTATIVE DEAL!&#10;&#10;The only Twitter that loves non-binding tentative deals more than Politics Twitter is Sports Twitter.&#10;&#10;The only Twitter that loves non-binding tentative deals more than Politics Twitter is Sports Twitter.&#10;&#10;They meant left-leaning, which is also funny. https://t.co/pVuTyAOvJG&#10;&#10;“Trudeau will be prime minister until 2025” which, OK, but do we even know what will happen this year, much less 3 years from now?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli Oh, that’s a great amount of time to spend there. I’m not much of a car driver, but having access to one on my last trip there was essential.&#10;Have you heard the it’s-funny-because-it’s-true joke that you should be prepared for three types of weather at all times?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli I’d love to hear about the trip during and afterwards. I assume you’ll do what I joke are the legally required tourist things, like tour the Golden Circle and go to the Blue Lagoon? Iceland’s tourist authorities will demand proof you’ve done those things.&#10;OK, no they won’t.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Now that almost all of the COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted in Ontario, never to return, since the pandemic is over, I still only have weak explanations about the strong reactions against them.&#10;&#10;The weak explanation I had about the “stop living in fear, live your life!” people was that they themselves lacked a fear response to basically anything. But that’s a brain disorder, and a rare one.&#10;&#10;The weak explanation I had about the people who complained that they couldn’t go to a restaurant or attend a party was that these were ecstatic experiences and that preventing them from having those experiences amounted to torture. But is dining out or partying that awesome?&#10;&#10;The weak explanation I had for people who protested against COVID-19 restrictions was that they didn’t actually believe in anything other than getting on TV. Going viral online was acceptable, with getting on the TV news being the ultimate goal for them. But was it?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@blogTO I’ve been wearing my mask even while alone in my apartment and while sleeping. I can’t wait for the mandate to wear it at all times to end tomorrow.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I’m marching in the St. Patrick’s Day Parade today. ☘️ Look for the people dressed up as Vikings! https://t.co/T7xt98C6Xg&#10;&#10;I dropped off at Yonge &amp;amp; Bloor. The Club President and her family are doing us proud for the rest of the way.&#10;&#10;Marching in a parade is not something I’d recommend camera shy people do.&#10;&#10;Yonge St. seemed a bit bare north of College, otherwise I was heartened by the turnout on Bloor and on Queen. Happy crowds are back again! https://t.co/ybzl2MC6RJ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Big day tomorrow. https://t.co/O4gD0Ju2N3&#10;&#10;I wonder what bad people are looking forward to doing tomorrow that they couldn’t do for the last two years.&#10;&#10;I went to the grocery store tonight. Not a lot of people there, which is normal just before closing. A noticeable few not wearing a mask, including an employee. No giant sign at the escalator anymore. I thought maybe there’s be one recommending the wearing of masks, but nope.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It’s the weekend before mask mandates are lifted in Toronto and I already feel like I’m in the minority in still wearing a mask in the public areas of my apartment building.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@BooksCassidy I only really changed my family name on Twitter (that said, it’s the name I was born with). It goes back to the one on my ID when I’m travelling. I use my “bowling name” in other contexts.&#10;File this under: If I have to explain it, I’m probably embarrassed by it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don’t look like anybody in my neighbourhood, don’t have a dog like seemingly everybody in my neighbourhood, don’t have a partner like seemingly everybody in my neighbourhood. I wonder if any of that’s true in Etobicoke.&#10;&#10;Is it quiet in Etobicoke? It’s constantly loud in Downtown Toronto.&#10;&#10;Has anybody spent a week or a month living in another part of town just to see what it would be like to move to that part of town? Asking for an Etobicoke.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I’ve updated the code that puts a beer emoji in your terminal prompt on Fridays for Zsh, the default shell for MacOS these days. https://t.co/fszt0svAEy&#10;&#10;There’s a burrito emoji now 🌯, but Wednesday is burrito day for me, not Tuesdays anymore, and I put a lemon 🍋 in my terminal prompt on Wednesdays, so I’ll have to think about that one. 🤔 https://t.co/qxpqE5mJy8&#10;&#10;</description>
