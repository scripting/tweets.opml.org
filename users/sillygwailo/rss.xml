			<description>&lt;p&gt;I didn’t go to the High Park bike protest tonight for the same reasons I left the bike party last month: As a non-owner, I didn’t think I’d feel like I’d be part of it and I didn’t have anybody to meet up with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Normally I go to protests I support, even if I don’t know anybody there, so that at least I’d increase the count by one. This one felt different. I didn’t feel like increasing the bike share user count by one.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AlexDRMather @DTAHtoronto @TorontoPFR @moddevelopments @DiamondSchmitt I live nearby, and it’s a big hit. When the food hall opens, it might be hard to find a seat (that’s a good problem for a park to have). The dog park is often full (which means people and the dogs who own them love it) and kids seem to enjoy the playground. Just a huge success.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@_jackiewong @overloaded_writ The grocery store was a classic, with a diner inside it. The mural is amazing because, well, I’ll leave it up to the crowdfunding campaign video to explain why: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Y3bWqHy6fa&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Y3bWqHy6fa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@_jackiewong @overloaded_writ This is terrific. The Leung family is legendary in the Comox Valley (where I’m from). The grocery store is so iconic that there’s a mural of it on the building where it once stood. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7idxGTiEQq&quot;&gt;https://t.co/7idxGTiEQq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@skinnylatte TIL that this book is a) real and b) categorized as “Humour/Reference” (i.e. half silly, half serious).

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I would’ve been a handsome hero today if I had happened to have hand lotion on me, but I didn’t, so I wasn’t. What I’m trying to tell you is that I just bought hand lotion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My handsome heroism today was limited to offering to take a group’s photo. Any time I see someone breaking off from a group to take a photo (or what looks like is going to be a bad group selfie [Hint: almost all group selfies are bad]), I wordlessly offer to take it for them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@toddsieling There’s a desktop mode, easily accessible, which seems pretty open, i.e. you can install software by downloading it from a browser. I didn’t do any unlocking or rooting to install itch.​io games, for example. I just had to install the Linux desktop client and login.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@toddsieling 🤔 I just found a less fiddly way to install Epic Games Store games, so maybe I’ll try that again. I installed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/QLPPDNTSSB&quot;&gt;https://t.co/QLPPDNTSSB&lt;/a&gt; launcher almost right after unboxing, though.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@toddsieling I do. I like it, but I don’t see myself using it for anything other than small games, or soothing exploration games. There’s one game that I’d play a lot on it if it were still on Steam. I could install it if I fiddle a bunch, but would rather not do that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to alarm you, but I think I’ve settled on a clothing style where I both look good and feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It’ll make my dad so happy to learn that, just like him, I’m going to be well stocked in collared shirts.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@anguspratt I have a cleaning service, since I don’t want to clean any of the surfaces in my place, though I only ever have them come in a day before I leave on an trip, so I can come back to a clean apartment. It’s all the other stuff like cooking and laundry that’s dull and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
