			<description>@davewiner My last memory of hitchhiking was when a buddy of mine and I needed a ride into town from his house (we were teens and almost the legal age to drive). The guy who picked us up talked about the pie he baked for a lady friend of his, in the hopes that he’d get some pie in return.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This looks similar to Toronto’s Queens Quay which, I contend, is a mess in a few places. https://t.co/b0TIZFpVGk&#10;&#10;You know what I did see at Queens Quay that I don’t see anywhere else in Toronto? A City employee picking up litter.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I’m going to Mississauga today by GO Transit. Cool, right?&#10;&#10;It was smooth sailing (on a train and then a bus) until I got to my stop, which Google Maps said was Financial Dr. and Derry Rd, but the GO Transit stop is labelled as Syntex Crt., a block away. Good thing I was paying attention!&#10;&#10;This plant near Financial Dr. and Syntex Crt. is right on a microconfluence. https://t.co/MXVv67HcT4&#10;&#10;The trip to Mississauga and back took 5 hours (including an hour of waiting since I got there early), to do one thing, and exchange, and it was exhausting. Of course I forgot a part of the thing I was exchanging, but the lady had compassion for me and said don’t worry about it.&#10;&#10;(I’m still going to mail the company the part, or sell it, or something, since I don’t have a use for it.)&#10;&#10;She assumed I drove there, because the whole built environment in that area assumes driving. I got the sense that a women on her break either laughed at me or took pity on me for walking there.&#10;&#10;It was pleasant riding the train and the bus to get there and back, I’ll give GO Transit that. It reminded me of my train/bus trips to America from B.C. It gave me the idea that maybe that’s how I go to the USA the next time, whenever that is.&#10;&#10;Was it weird that there was a sign on the door that said, due to the disease that we can get even if vaccinated, which shreds our lungs and causes permanent brain damage, that we’ll get over and over until it ultimately kills us, I had to call to be let in, but nobody picked up?&#10;&#10;Was it weird that there was a sign on the door that said, due to the disease that we can get even if vaccinated, which shreds our lungs and causes permanent brain damage, that we’ll get over and over until it ultimately kills us, everybody had to wear a mask, but no staff did?&#10;&#10;Was it weird that, even though there’s a disease that we can get even if vaccinated, which shreds our lungs and causes permanent brain damage, that we’ll get over and over until it ultimately kills us, the lady coughed on the item I was receiving and she didn’t sanitize it?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@cqwww Box breathing is the easiest breathing exercise for me to remember how to do.&#10;Separately: Counting each breath has been the easiest way for me to keep the focus on it. If I get distracted, I just start the count again.&#10;(I have a Headspace subscription as a perk from work.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli What’s an example of something that’s not working? Not because I think I have a solution, but because I have the same combo and maybe I’m missing something (that is, maybe I got used to something and there’s a better way to live).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@CanBball GLOBL JAM felt a bit too expensive to attend live this year, but I hope you hold it again next year. It was fun to watch on TV, and if any of the games take place in the Toronto/Hamilton area next year, I’ll go in person. #GLOBLJAM https://t.co/dOO7MkbJhl&#10;&#10;@CanBball Any chance of introducing the Elam Ending to the rules for GLOBL JAM next year? It would mean no more backcourt fouls and no rushed possessions at the end of the game. #GLOBLJAM&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>TIL about @torontolibrary’s online title recommendation form, which limits releases only to less than 2 years old and one purchase request per calendar month. What can I, personally, do to get the library to change its policy lift those limits? https://t.co/03xesNzKfV&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@inHrEye Hold on, say that again? Your smartwatch couldn’t tell you the time because of the Rogers outage? The fact that there’s no watch face without a clock on it is literally the only reason I don’t own an Apple Watch. https://t.co/FAXB1M6sRE&#10;&#10;</description>
