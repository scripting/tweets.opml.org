			<description>4 more years of Governing By Threading the Needle, which at least beats Governing By Backtracking. https://t.co/VdqtGYuAjY&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you’re in Ontario and you need to get something off your chest without anybody noticing, tonight might be a good time to do it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I voted. https://t.co/COtVExZeUi&#10;&#10;The Hyatt Regency Hotel on King St. W. does not allow directional signs in the lobby for where specifically I was to cast my ballot, apparently. I had to ask an attendant if I was at the right place. I made my voice heard to the elections workers. They felt their hands were tied.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I’m gonna play the heck out of this. Hopefully soothing exploration is an option. I’m not really into narrative elements of games, but I did find the sitting in judgment part of Dragon Age: Inquisition compelling. https://t.co/4Xaxzd1GZK&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli It’s usually a bad idea to declare that you haven’t done something, because you only have done it once for it to be a lie, and even so, declaring that you didn’t do something makes people suspect you indeed did it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What are the predictions as to when there will be projections for the results of the Ontario election? Is there a place to bet on when projections will come from the various media entities? Is politics betting legal in Ontario? #onelxn #onpoli #ontariovotes #ontarioelection2022&#10;&#10;I had 9:17 PM as the time I bet that the first major media entity would project a majority government.&#10;&#10;It’s over now. You don’t have to watch any of the election coverage any more. All the speeches will be on YouTube tomorrow. If it’s not your job to cover the election, you can literally do anything else if you so choose.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>To get ahead of the story, I will not accept the nomination as leader of the Ontario NDP, and will not serve if elected.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@leppert This is sad news, but I knew this day would come. Any chance of open-sourcing the software behind it? I know that everything requires maintenance, and even considered asking to take it over, until I realized I hadn't considered how much effort it might take.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is sad news. Reading is one of my favourite web apps of all time. I will still post to @sglisreading, though with my cobbled-together solution of Pinboard, RSS, and Huggin, taped together with love. https://t.co/UmYtXr2cPI&#10;&#10;Reading was magical because:&#10;&#10;1. You could tell who read something because of you.&#10;2. You could see who was reading something from individual domains.&#10;3. You could “Yep” (heartily suggest something) or “Nope” (recommend against something), and it had hooks for each.&#10;&#10;I posted over 11,000 articles to Reading: https://t.co/dYpGkFeURG&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Happy Jubilee! We in Canada are celebrating by *not* having a day off from work and *not* having a parade, even though Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has ruled over our country with just as firm an iron fist and for just as long as she has over her other realms.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>When the parking fines eclipse the value of the Russian airplane at Toronto Pearson Airport, can, I dunno, can I have it? I know it’d be a lot of work to take care of, but, I dunno, I kind of want it. https://t.co/7JVHm91msj&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@syncros Oh, that’s the guy who annoyed his girlfriend with hilarious radio station promos where he gets the frequency from gas prices they see on the street. It must be a shame that they’re in the $2+ range now.&#10;I see they’re married now. That warms my heart.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@matttomic For a snack, would you like a Tyler Danish? Or a Stephen Piscotty (which I mishear as biscotti)?&#10;My hobby is to keep track of white baseball players whose names sound delicious.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Tonight. https://t.co/8PSSDPURbW&#10;&#10;If God invented anything better than the SkyDome roof opening, he kept that shit for Himself. https://t.co/cVNwDMarqL&#10;&#10;Just a great feeling. And it lasts for over 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;I can’t believe I live in Toronto. https://t.co/wJr4PCRVFH&#10;&#10;I really like this Santiago Espinal guy. https://t.co/qEVlWaPumb&#10;&#10;Toronto’s Department of Sunsets must have known the SkyDome’s roof would be open tonight. https://t.co/EqvMU6HekG&#10;&#10;VAR is killing baseball.&#10;&#10;My view from the cheap seats. https://t.co/kjqdudqjTq&#10;&#10;Jake Burger is another white baseball player whose name sounds delicious. I’m adding him to the list. https://t.co/MhhbfqbkMz&#10;&#10;Blue Jays win! https://t.co/Pd9sIfEPlY&#10;&#10;No Adam Cimber tonight. I was hoping to get to dance to his walk-up song in the stands. 🙌🏻 @CimberFan https://t.co/8EIF3lZDnv&#10;&#10;</description>
