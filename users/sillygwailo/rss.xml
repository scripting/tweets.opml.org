			<description>&lt;p&gt;@rtanglao I air fry chicken pre-made tenders regularly now. It’s the main reason I bought it. I’ve also roasted broccoli and cauliflower. Fries made from scratch are on the list (though I’m trying to cut down on the potatoes in my diet).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I bought perforated ticket card stock one time, thinking I would print real tickets out of all of my virtual ones, but it would have been quite the effort. Now I ask at venues if there’s a keepsake ticket stub I can have. The answer is usually no. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/YB1bgVEQzK&quot;&gt;https://t.co/YB1bgVEQzK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if they do it anymore, but up until fairly recently, some baseball stadiums would, once you were inside, give you a paper ticket if you asked for it at the customer service desk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Alt text seems to follow a certain format, doesn’t it? Two or three sentences, to the point, with no flourishes.  “A cat with a bell around its neck is lying on a chair. There is a shawl on the back of the chair.” The last sentence is usually about a detail from the photo.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best experiences I’ve ever had playing video games was playing Overcooked via couch co-op. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MN1sV5dzLp&quot;&gt;https://t.co/MN1sV5dzLp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That experience informed what I was truly looking for in a romantic partner, like, y’know, whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Think I could get you to post more Live Photos to Twitter?

I don’t mean for you. I mean for me, someone who has a high-end iPhone, a high-end computer, and really fast Internet connections (plural). How can I make it so that Twitter doesn’t compress images for me specifically?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This afternoon. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/D3r1XO3szR&quot;&gt;https://t.co/D3r1XO3szR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I paid $10 to get in when there was 25 minutes left. The woman at the front desk gave me a funny look but still charged the full entrance fee. What I didn’t tell her is that I wanted to know what a gem expo looked like, and it was worth $10 for me to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I was more interested in the psychics and astrology and faux-astrology booths at the back than the gems and crystals tables. I didn’t get a reading (everybody was booked up), but I did get a birth month card for $5.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I’m pretty skeptical about readings based on charts and coincidences, but I will never say no if it’s offered. Every reading I’ve got had something in there about me that, even if it was in opposition to what I think is true, I didn’t know was true or false to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@chenoehart I can’t find a shirt that I love, and it has gone through … enough repairs. I’ve asked a tailor to copy it, and he obliged. He took measurements of the shirt, sent them overseas (I have no idea where), and I’ll I see the results next month. If it works, I’ll buy 5 more.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A friend asked me yesterday if I had plans for the weekend, and I told him I didn’t, which was true. Somehow I ended up walking around Yorkville, then Ossington, then biked to an outdoor art fair, then biked to a French festival, then watched sports at an open-air stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;There’s an old Archie comic where Jughead shows his pal around Riverdale and does basically all of the free things possible in town, and Archie comes around to being impressed with how much one can do without spending money. I think about that comic on days like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I rode part of this today. Total chaos. People were yelling out from their second storey window about it, I shit you not. And I almost got into a fight with a guy I yelled at for walking in the bike lane. (I diffused the situation by telling him to go away.) &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/B4mnZ4wiFU&quot;&gt;https://t.co/B4mnZ4wiFU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;These are parked cars on Tecumseth St. south of Queen St., and yes, really. It must have been painted yesterday. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/O48sN9BVD7&quot;&gt;https://t.co/O48sN9BVD7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I’m actually good with this if it works. I’ve seen it work in other places here, like a downtown Toronto street near where I live. It’s just that the locals think it’s madness, and I was witness to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One local yelled out “This isn’t Copenhagen!” which, well, duh. Copenhagen is a different city than it was 20 years ago, and Toronto will be a different city in 20 years, much to the chagrin of people who hate trying things imported from other places to see if they’ll work here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@rtanglao Darn. Well, everyone I see carrying a camera on a strap are so well-dressed. Maybe not everyone, I did see a couple of dudes dressed in boring clothes today, but as a rule, “photographers” usually seem well put together.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<source:markdown>@rtanglao Darn. Well, everyone I see carrying a camera on a strap are so well-dressed. Maybe not everyone, I did see a couple of dudes dressed in boring clothes today, but as a rule, “photographers” usually seem well put together.&#10;&#10;&#10;</source:markdown>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;There’s a guy at the @bikepartyTO with a @BikeShareTO bike. I wonder if he feels welcome here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He left. He didn’t feel welcome. Plus, he forgot that he hates parties and ends up sitting on the couch alone each time. He’s now watching the Toronto Rush take on the Philadelphia Phoenix in American Ultimate Disc League action at the University of Toronto’s Varsity Stadium.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amazing backdrop for an Ultimate game. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/eRLaQmFwtG&quot;&gt;https://t.co/eRLaQmFwtG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Amazing backdrop for an Ultimate game. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nPryEwJ6mn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/nPryEwJ6mn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The bike party was full of bike owners. I saw one bike share rider (maybe there were others) when it rolled past me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Owning a bike is a commitment to maintenance, finding a place for it in your abode, and eventually having it stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The tradeoff to not owning a bike and using bike share to get around is that, when the time on your ride is nearing the limit, your head is on a swivel looking for a bike dock. And the bikes themselves are less than great.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And feeling like a loser at a bike party.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
