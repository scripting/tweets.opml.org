			<description>@leppert This is sad news, but I knew this day would come. Any chance of open-sourcing the software behind it? I know that everything requires maintenance, and even considered asking to take it over, until I realized I hadn't considered how much effort it might take.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is sad news. Reading is one of my favourite web apps of all time. I will still post to @sglisreading, though with my cobbled-together solution of Pinboard, RSS, and Huggin, taped together with love. https://t.co/UmYtXr2cPI&#10;&#10;Reading was magical because:&#10;&#10;1. You could tell who read something because of you.&#10;2. You could see who was reading something from individual domains.&#10;3. You could ‚ÄúYep‚Äù (heartily suggest something) or ‚ÄúNope‚Äù (recommend against something), and it had hooks for each.&#10;&#10;I posted over 11,000 articles to Reading: https://t.co/dYpGkFeURG&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Happy Jubilee! We in Canada are celebrating by *not* having a day off from work and *not* having a parade, even though Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has ruled over our country with just as firm an iron fist and for just as long as she has over her other realms.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>When the parking fines eclipse the value of the Russian airplane at Toronto Pearson Airport, can, I dunno, can I have it? I know it‚Äôd be a lot of work to take care of, but, I dunno, I kind of want it. https://t.co/7JVHm91msj&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@syncros Oh, that‚Äôs the guy who annoyed his girlfriend with hilarious radio station promos where he gets the frequency from gas prices they see on the street. It must be a shame that they‚Äôre in the $2+ range now.&#10;I see they‚Äôre married now. That warms my heart.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@matttomic For a snack, would you like a Tyler Danish? Or a Stephen Piscotty (which I mishear as biscotti)?&#10;My hobby is to keep track of white baseball players whose names sound delicious.&#10;&#10;</description>

And it lasts for over 20 minutes.&#10;&#10;I can‚Äôt believe I live in Toronto. https://t.co/wJr4PCRVFH&#10;&#10;I really like this Santiago Espinal guy. https://t.co/qEVlWaPumb&#10;&#10;Toronto‚Äôs Department of Sunsets must have known the SkyDome‚Äôs roof would be open tonight. https://t.co/EqvMU6HekG&#10;&#10;VAR is killing baseball.&#10;&#10;My view from the cheap seats. https://t.co/kjqdudqjTq&#10;&#10;Jake Burger is another white baseball player whose name sounds delicious. I‚Äôm adding him to the list. https://t.co/MhhbfqbkMz&#10;&#10;Blue Jays win! https://t.co/Pd9sIfEPlY&#10;&#10;No Adam Cimber tonight.
