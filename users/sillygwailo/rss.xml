			<description>Count me as a part-owner of TSS Rovers Football Club. I bought exactly one share, and if I lose my investment, so be it. This feels like something I want to be a part of with a tie back to my home province. Go Rovers Go! @SOTR_Vancouver @swanguardians https://t.co/zfNZAnUsY5&#10;&#10;I’ll be giving away my season ticket, if indeed that’s the perk I get, hopefully earmarked for youths to attend.&#10;&#10;If there’s any other sports club that has a 49% fan ownership model in Canada, especially if it has a youth team, and even more especially if it helps support young women and girls in athletics, please let me know. I want to be a part of that.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>The 6th wave of the pandemic feels like the “everybody’s going to eventually get COVID-19 and if not die from it right away, then at least slowly over time as you keep getting it year after year” phase, but it’s still not the “tell your crushes you’re in love with them” phase.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@uncleweed He won me over when he kept the take with his cat entering the frame in one of his videos about transit during the pandemic. It felt like a “You know what, kitty? I love you, and this video wouldn’t be perfect without you” moment.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This was on my list! It was under the section of things I thought were only possible during a Democratic House, Senate and Presidency. It feels good to check it off. https://t.co/nJ5MAcr0FS&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I regret not announcing my candidacy to be appointed councillor for Spadina-Fort York sooner. I would be a single-issue councillor, advocating for organics pickup citywide (including for residents living in apartments and condominiums). https://t.co/omcsD1iyIi&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>When the TTC replaces the Scarborough RT, can, I dunno, can I have it? I know it’d be a lot of work to take care of, but, I dunno, I kind of want it. https://t.co/N9ZnibOnEr&#10;&#10;What if, and hear me out on this, how about instead of demolishing the whole thing, we keep the section between Lawrence East and Scarborough Centre (or, let’s say, Midland), and the TTC just gives it to me. I’ll automate the system and maintain it. Deal? https://t.co/XD3IWUrgrG&#10;&#10;Uh, assuming I don’t take on any of its debt. And after I crowdfund millions of dollars for keeping that part of the system up. And set up a charitable foundation to keep it funded.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@hankgreen I’ll unfollow someone if their last [x] amount of tweets are about a subject that’s wearing me out. Hopefully someone will RT them into my stream.&#10;I’ll unfollow mean people that I don’t learn anything from. That said, because you’re mean isn’t a sufficient reason to unfollow.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I’m at the highly scripted campaign launch for the Ontario branch of Canada’s orange-branded political party. https://t.co/7pnywpp1YF&#10;&#10;I’m not the only greying white guy who came here alone on transit. I’m keeping an eye on him, though that makes me wonder: Who’s keeping an eye on me?&#10;&#10;He did the same thing I was doing there, which was not much. Just there to listen, as far as I could tell.&#10;&#10;Events should have an “onlies” section so we can know who else is there and not waiting for someone to join them and whom it’s OK to try to make friends with.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This might be the last Duke-UNC game I watch as a fan of the Blue Devils. The Coach K era is over after this year, and so with it, the end of an era of cheering for an NCAA basketball team.&#10;&#10;Back-and-forth basketball. I couldn’t ask for anything more.&#10;&#10;They’re a 20-minute drive from each other. https://t.co/mI4z8nMyA4&#10;&#10;Wild game. Hold on to your butts.&#10;&#10;Standing up for the last minute.&#10;&#10;Great game. Great finish.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@toddsieling I forget the account, but there was someone who was watching the #nofilter hashtag on Instagram for photos that were actually run through a filter and pointing out which filter they used. I wonder if that’s possible in this case.&#10;&#10;</description>
