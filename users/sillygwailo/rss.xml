			<description>I can’t wait to add the Steam Deck to the pile of gaming consoles that I haven’t opened the box for. https://t.co/QcSphTIiBj&#10;&#10;I still haven’t opened box for my Nintendo Switch or Ring Fit, and I just bought Switch Sports.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Heavy hearted in Toronto tonight. He and I might have followed each other for a brief period. From the sound of it, he lives on in the hearts of the many people he knew and loved, and who loved him. He was my age. RIP. https://t.co/VumkP2memc&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This afternoon. https://t.co/cDkMnVjlfL&#10;&#10;If you’re the type of person who attends street festivals, there’s a booth at Do West Fest selling football lanyards, and I got an Iceland one. I’m not saying it’s officially-sanctioned or anything, just that’s where you can get one. https://t.co/BhuSIbWQRD&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Kyle Garlick is ridiculous.&#10;&#10;He’s a white baseball player that has a name that sounds like food, but he’s not going on the list, because, unless I’m missing something, garlic on its own is not delicious.&#10;&#10;I stand corrected. https://t.co/bFbmwleWen&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This for a movie shoot, and it’s causing a traffic jam forcing drivers to turn left, and *then* they have to turn left on a one-way street, i.e. they have turn around before having to turn around again. I assume the people who complain about #ActiveTO are upset about this, too. https://t.co/uKmE6Y9xok&#10;&#10;An FDNY fire truck parked next to Lofts 399 on Adelaide St. W. https://t.co/Fbeyqaqdhx&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Remember FOAF? https://t.co/hetuzJy15b&#10;&#10;I found my FOAF file from back in the day. All of the FOAF URLs it references are 404. So, technically, is mine.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@domesticat I’m sort of … not quite embarrassed by that, but I try to balance the big deal I make of it with the humility of not being very skilled in those languages, because I’m worried I’ll be tested on it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I need to tell an interviewer for an internal talk show at work a little fun fact or something I’d like to share with people that they may not know about me. Something interesting that I’m not embarrassed about, obviously. What should I tell the interviewer?&#10;&#10;I won a search engine contest in 2004. Is that interesting? I wanted to prove that having a blog was good for SEO. To encourage people to link to me, and so that some good could come of it, I promised I’d make a donation to charity if I won, a promise I kept.&#10;&#10;Winning the search engine contest feels like of the few thing I set out to do, felt sure I could get done, and was right, and that was a long time ago. Everything else I can think of fell into my lap and all I had to do was say Yes.&#10;&#10;I’m leaning towards requesting that the interviewer not ask the question.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I voted. https://t.co/COtVExZeUi&#10;&#10;The Hyatt Regency Hotel on King St. W. does not allow directional signs in the lobby for where specifically I was to cast my ballot, apparently. I had to ask an attendant if I was at the right place. I made my voice heard to the elections workers. They felt their hands were tied.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I’m gonna play the heck out of this. Hopefully soothing exploration is an option. I’m not really into narrative elements of games, but I did find the sitting in judgment part of Dragon Age: Inquisition compelling. https://t.co/4Xaxzd1GZK&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kimli It’s usually a bad idea to declare that you haven’t done something, because you only have done it once for it to be a lie, and even so, declaring that you didn’t do something makes people suspect you indeed did it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What are the predictions as to when there will be projections for the results of the Ontario election? Is there a place to bet on when projections will come from the various media entities? Is politics betting legal in Ontario? #onelxn #onpoli #ontariovotes #ontarioelection2022&#10;&#10;I had 9:17 PM as the time I bet that the first major media entity would project a majority government.&#10;&#10;It’s over now. You don’t have to watch any of the election coverage any more. All the speeches will be on YouTube tomorrow. If it’s not your job to cover the election, you can literally do anything else if you so choose.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@leppert This is sad news, but I knew this day would come. Any chance of open-sourcing the software behind it? I know that everything requires maintenance, and even considered asking to take it over, until I realized I hadn't considered how much effort it might take.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is sad news. Reading is one of my favourite web apps of all time. I will still post to @sglisreading, though with my cobbled-together solution of Pinboard, RSS, and Huggin, taped together with love. https://t.co/UmYtXr2cPI&#10;&#10;Reading was magical because:&#10;&#10;1. You could tell who read something because of you.&#10;2. You could see who was reading something from individual domains.&#10;3. You could “Yep” (heartily suggest something) or “Nope” (recommend against something), and it had hooks for each.&#10;&#10;I posted over 11,000 articles to Reading: https://t.co/dYpGkFeURG&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Happy Jubilee! We in Canada are celebrating by *not* having a day off from work and *not* having a parade, even though Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II has ruled over our country with just as firm an iron fist and for just as long as she has over her other realms.&#10;&#10;</description>
