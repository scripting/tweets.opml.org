			<description>@2lowtech Yup. And they informed me of the data breach when it happened. But I’ve had 3 or 4 others as well. 🤷🏼‍♂️&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rickg Yes, but… I’ve received notifications about four similar breeches in the past year or so. I don’t have enough information to blame any one of those companies. And it wouldn’t do any good anyway. ;)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@mkizer Yup, that’s my thought to. Seriously, I wouldn’t put money into an account I didn’t open, for starters. And then for me to be sent the debit card; that doesn’t help the scammers either. Whatever. Accounts frozen.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@MultiMatt @googlechrome @chromeunboxed Nope, I’ve never seen that behavior. If it keeps happening, I’d report it so the devs can look into it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>First food stop for this n00b rider. Not the best choice but it’ll do! https://t.co/XhjVVPiLrJ&#10;&#10;So although I would have taken a ride in the nice weather regardless, I actually had a VERY interesting, and unnerving, reason to make a 20 mile trek today. Last week I got an email from a bank saying “Congrats on opening your new checking account”. Except I don’t use that bank.&#10;&#10;I figured it was a phishing scam, so I deleted the email. This week, I got an actual debit card for my new checking account at this bank. That freaked me out. So today, I rode out to the closest branch of the bank; I’m not naming it because it doesn’t matter to the story.&#10;&#10;I got to the bank this afternoon and a teller asked if she could help me. I explained that I received a debit card but I don’t bank here. She shouted out “We got another one….” Apparently, I wasn’t the first person to have this happen to recently.&#10;&#10;I was taken to an office with a bank rep and she explained to me that this has been happening a lot lately. She asked if she could take the debit card, which of course, I said yes. She cut it up after looking my license to verify I was who I said I was.&#10;&#10;Then I asked “What information was tied to the checking account that I didn’t open?” We went through it all. When the account was opened they used my name, address, my son’s phone number (weird) and here’s the kicker: My exact social security number.&#10;&#10;Needless to say, this is not good. I’ve already frozen my credit reports but it’s very disconcerting that my SS is out there. Nothing I can do now but watch my credit, which shouldn’t have any changes due to freezing the account but…. WOW.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@davewiner I read religiously sometime between 12:01 and 3:00am. ;) Between your effort and Typefully, I too wonder what Twitter will do (if anything) in regards to RSS.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@WarnerCrocker @HouseGOP I hear you. But as a registered independent, I try (sometimes too hard, I admit) to have an open mind and see the differing POV. This was just too far for me to keep quiet during a very turbulent time.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I get that @HouseGOP thinks it's &quot;owning the libs&quot; with this. What it fails to realize (or even worse, does realize and ignores) is that a unified country &amp;amp; world suffers from this tripe. You do you GOP, but really: tone it down a notch by understanding you're not helping here. https://t.co/5GiKxUaobb&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@luskwater Hmm... on Chrome OS 98, I just tested it with a few apps. The first search result has a thin box around it, indicating to me that it has focus. I press the RETURN key and it opens whatever app has the focus, so working for me. Could be broken outside of Stable though.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@fcassia I haven’t noticed but then again, I only test battery life on the Stable Channel. Power efficiency isn’t one of the first things tested when new features are being developed; it’s usually something that happens later in the cycle. I wouldn’t worry; at least not yet.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@fcassia Wow, didn’t realize Box had pulled their Chrome OS integration. No idea why because it really shouldn’t matter to any cloud provider which operating system people use for it’s services. I wonder if there’s a way to use their Android app and see your data in the CrOS Files app? 🤔&#10;&#10;</description>
