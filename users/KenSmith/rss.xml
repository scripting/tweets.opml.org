			<description>&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata I once served on the IT committee. It seemed like the director thought the university&amp;#39;s computer network would be perfected if only she could keep humans from touching it. As in your essay, our expertise is sterile if it excludes the humanity of those we are supposed to serve.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata In different fields, you hear stories of professionals trying to remind themselves of this, trying to train newcomers to understand this. Medical schools that ask students to read literary works by Chekhov, W.C. Williams, Coles, eg.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata At a military museum once, I photographed all the places on large pieces of artillery that were meant to be held or operated by a human hand. A piece of equipment relentlessly trains up a person into being a part of the machine, even part of a killing machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata Different things help us resist the narrowness of our training. Interdisciplinary study, where we learn the tools for seeing used by many fields, can help. The arts, which are about rejiggering our perceptions, our hearts and minds, can help. Identifying with the other person...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata In academic fields, the opportunity to write not just about the tools of the field, but about the field&amp;#39;s human context as well, seems vital, though this may not be common. Your essay is an important example.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata I also like the way your essay acknowledges that a technician should not pretend there are no emotions in doing the work. No boredom, no anger, say, for the technician. No emotional need for the medical patient.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata In The Use of Force, William Carlos Williams tells about a doctor like himself becoming angry with the parents who have delayed getting help for their child because they didn&amp;#39;t have money to pay for it, and angry too at the frightened child who fought back against the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata That doctor&amp;#39;s desire to merely carry out the technical task is thwarted, and the doctor sees his own emotions rising unprofessionally. At that moment, the practice of medicine is deeply interwoven in a very flawed but understandable humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@moritz @jrmdns @noisydata All of which is to say, Please be sure to use this essay of yours going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@davewiner @MarkLeibovich Just before his downfall, in his memoir, Senator Al Franken portrayed Mr. Cruz as despised by their Senate colleagues, but the portrait of Washington in @MarkLeibovich’s book suggests that the DC GOP will now hold their noses through almost anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2fUWH2T1fY&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2fUWH2T1fY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MarkLeibovich I was passenger in a loud car crossing Ohio, less than ideal even for blogging. And I’d heard the audio driving across Pennsylvania, so I took no notes. But you portrayed the bums as grasping and cowardly, which matched the Pence we Hoosiers (apologize) regifted to the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Howard Brody wrote that medical experts must understand, accept and own up to the responsibilities of their healing &amp;amp; social powers, and must aim those powers in service, not self-aggrandizement, by sharing the power knowingly with patients. @AnnaDeForest hits related notes here. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/uXl2QBR5Pu&quot;&gt;https://t.co/uXl2QBR5Pu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
