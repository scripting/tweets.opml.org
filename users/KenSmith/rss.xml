			<description>&lt;p&gt;A courteous person called from the management of Martin&amp;#39;s stores in our area. I believe I summarize accurately this way: If they notice a person with an open carry weapon in the store, and the person does not seem problematic, they do nothing more than quietly observe. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JDN13zn3dG&quot;&gt;https://t.co/JDN13zn3dG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the person is challenging or disruptive in some way, staff are trained to call 9-1-1, he said. He said he would pass my concerns up to the higher management, which I guess means SpartanNash.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I told him that Schnucks stores in St. Louis take a stronger approach, and I described the sign posted in the store in Chesterfield, a suburb of St. Louis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lfT84g1a6E&quot;&gt;https://t.co/lfT84g1a6E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also mentioned the choice a company makes to lay low and do and say nothing on a public issue like this one, vs. being part of the conversation. Do we want weapons going in and out in stores, which are private property? Martin&amp;#39;s/SpartanNash could help lead an area conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also asked if it mattered that other people might bring them into the conversation even if they choose not to step forward themselves. I mentioned having a voice in regional radio, for example. He said he would pass along his notes to those above him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add: when there was an open carry event at a neighborhood store, I mentioned it to the person at the front desk. That person seemed to do nothing and did not look into it. &amp;quot;No policy against it&amp;quot; was all he said. That&amp;#39;s a little different than the phone call suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My overall impression is that the management person who called me back recognized the complexity of our times, and the company was reluctant to seem political. So I don&amp;#39;t imagine they&amp;#39;ll do anything different, but at least concern has been registered.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Join in, if you live in the region and if you like. Their email link is far-bottom-right on this home page.&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/xgvkQynaaM&quot;&gt;https://t.co/xgvkQynaaM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

That's a little different than the phone call suggested.&#10;&#10;My overall impression is that the management person who called me back recognized the complexity of our times, and the company was reluctant to seem political. So I don't imagine they'll do anything different, but at least concern has been registered.&#10;&#10;Join in, if you live in the region and if you like. Their email link is far-bottom-right on this home page.&#10;https://t.co/xgvkQynaaM&#10;&#10;</source:markdown>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;IN-2nd Representative @RepWalorski / @JackieWalorski voted today against the Respect for Marriage Act, HR 8404, which protects a person legally married in one state from later being denied marriage rights in another state because of their sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a short bill that anyone can easily read and understand, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DeJkbRABMO&quot;&gt;https://t.co/DeJkbRABMO&lt;/a&gt;&#10;Roll call vote: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UWSxaRLcKD&quot;&gt;https://t.co/UWSxaRLcKD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No clues yet from Ms. Walorski&amp;#39;s social media or website about the reason for her vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it appears Ms. Walorski would like one state to be able to use reasons of sex, race, ethnicity, or nation origin as valid reasons to challenge the marriage rights of someone living there. Why else vote against? She&amp;#39;s not great at informing voter of her views, beyond slogans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love decoding blurbs and dodging their hyperboles and satirizing them. I wrote a blurb once that I offer now to any writer vain enough to feel deserving of it:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These poems will be read in Paradise&#10;as God&amp;#39;s wake-up call all the mornings of eternity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
