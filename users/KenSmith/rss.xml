			<description>@SBTOutdoors I remember one of the little towns we passed in southeastern Alaska on the Ferry that looked like it was using the shoreline as the town dump.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SBTOutdoors The Chilkoot Trail was very little developed when we walked it. It was easy to go astray, and we did. There was no helicopter to bring a struggling tourist out like we saw in the Grand Canyon a few weeks before.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@HormoneHangover My father told one of his work friends about the trip in my presence the next year as if it was kind of a cool accomplishment, but I'm sure he disapproved of the risk of getting off track in life too. My mother's view--one could still ask...&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>In 1973, I spent 50¢ for an old used guidebook to Alaska. I found it for sale on a table of culled books in the entry at the public library. The chapters on southeastern Alaska recommended one remote town’s forest boardwalk.&#10;&#10;The boardwalk, shown in a dim black and white photo (the book was full of these), was described as a scenic shortcut through ferny evergreen forest and wetland to a secluded, pebbly spot along the shore.&#10;&#10;Walking that way in 1974, we found long stretches of its wet planks crumbling into shady, mossy, sodden soil. The purpose of the 11-week trip was to explore the longest possible route from home to a nearby college.&#10;&#10;✅ Route: scenic&#10;✅ Boots: soaked&#10;✅ College: delayed&#10;&#10;Moral of the story: While carrying out research, use caution when consulting older sources.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I hear that in a Joe Pickett novel by C. J. Box, set in Wyoming and nearby states, you’re sure to see Joe destroy a pickup truck, Marybeth solve murders in Saddlestring, and Nate get revenge. A friend recommends them. https://t.co/rOAAKlc6Tw&#10;&#10;</description>

He was speaking with people he knew well once when I walked up. In a moment or two he excused himself from those folks and turned to me, a stranger. https://t.co/scxS6MJ8NP&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@lisajpetrie On a trip last August, our car's AC broke and we crossed western and northern Iowa with the windows down. From great distances we sniffed approaching CAFOs, which were plentiful. One or two employee cars parked outside each building, a dismal portrait of a once-proud rural life.&#10;&#10;</description>
