			<description>When writing is going well, organization both precedes and follows content. That's why a person might want to compose right there in the outline.&#10;#toolsforthought&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you write about the same thing three days in a row, 1) the focus will likely tighten, 2) the grain of the thinking grow finer, and 3) the organization evolve.&#10;I now think that those three things are the same thing, three ways of noticing and naming the process of writing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AndySylvester99 I like the principle, the practice, for sure.&#10;It reminds me of a collaboration many years ago between dozens of American poets, who all wrote a poem that included the presence of a woman in a black raincoat. It ended up as a book. (Maybe it was red.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@davewiner @ReasonedWriting I like the different kinds of outlines and uses being mentioned in this thread. It's starting to feel like we need names for outlines that serve very different uses. Schools used to ask for simple-minded topics listed in a sensible order, maybe with indenting for the details.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting Maybe that simple school outline is a rudimentary planning outline.&#10;&#10;The planning outline @ReasonedWriting describes involves a lot more thought about the relationships in the content. It reflects higher order mental activity and deserves its own name.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting And that sophisticated planning outline starts edging toward writing itself, which if it is carried out in an outliner software tool weaves composing, ordering, and revising together from start to finish. That probably needs a name.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting And a further step is the fine-grained work organizing, finding, revealing the relationship between one sentence and the next, one phrase and the next. That is a refinement of skill and thought that the rudimentary school outline is oblivious to.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting For example, should there be an &quot;and&quot; or a &quot;but&quot; between two adjoining sentences? That's a kind of organizing of thought and argument, but is it useful to think of it as part of the more sophisticated sorts of outlining? I don't honestly know.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting I suppose part of the lesson here is that the best of our #toolsforthought can be used in very rudimentary or very sophisticated ways. Can be built to encourage the one or the other. Can be taught to encourage the one or the other.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting ...can be taught SO AS to encourage the one or the other. (correction for clarity)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I spoke in a university class yesterday. One question asked: If we want to have a protest in front of the courthouse tomorrow, would Twitter be the organizing tool to use?&#10;My answer: Probably, no, but maybe, it depends on what kind of web you have in place as a writer.&#10;&#10;If one's online publishing is mainly a monologue, then it's not going to work.&#10;&#10;If you've built a web of readers and writers who engage with each other around a topic, then tapping into that might work.&#10;&#10;Gotta use the keyboard often to make things happen away from the keyboard.&#10;&#10;</description>
