			<description>Responsibility&#10;to renewable systems&#10;would be a satisfying&#10;and enduring cultural story&#10;much better than our current one,&#10;which glorifies the frantic&#10;and ecstatic strip-mining&#10;of the planet’s resources,&#10;crashing the natural systems&#10;that make the resources&#10;in the first place.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bessbell Years ago, August heat wave, 1 or 2 am, no air conditioning, windows open, baby screaming in the apartment across the narrow alley.  These voices in the night:&#10;Exhausted mother: “What does he want?!”&#10;Bitter man, in a drawl: “He don’t wont sheeit.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>First day of spring semester, 1977, walking on a campus sidewalk. Ahead on the cement, I see a piece of paper money. Picked it up, looked around, said, “It’s a $100 bill.”&#10;The young woman walking behind me said, “I should have gotten out of bed five minutes earlier today.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If memory serves me, part of what brought the Cuban missile crisis to an end was the U.S. agreeing to remove some missiles from near the Soviet Union, in Turkey.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/3 The Stones are on the box, loud enough so I notice the drums. Next song, again it's the drums. I usually think the Stones are about the sting of the guitars and the backbone and sneer and syrup of the voice and the words, but no, tonight the drummer is the front man.&#10;&#10;2/3 Music teaches young people how to feel something, I think my sister said. Maybe that's the wound steel of the strings stretched and plucked, doing their part, but tonight the drums seem to say: don't just feel something, you'd better move.&#10;&#10;3/3 The backbone, the attitude, well, we need that whenever we move out into the streets. The words might help us know why that is. Help us set sweet against bitter as we go.&#10;&#10;And then one of the cruel songs comes on.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@cameronponsonby @blzzrd I grew up in a family of goalkeepers and goalie coaches in St. Louis, Missouri, one of the U.S.’s few real old football towns. Everyone I show this article to texts me saying, “Yes!” My brother’s son said, “Dad, you used to shout those same things at the TV when I was a kid.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>When a person or a country decides to make war, no only do they destroy visible and tangible things, but they also steal hours of everyday life for years to come. Putin is a thief, one among many. https://t.co/eG0cIJECr5&#10;&#10;</description>
