			<description>Carrying and giving birth to a child is difficult, dangerous, and even traumatic. Carrying the child of one's abuser after rape or incest is akin to psychological abuse. Certain medical conditions can lead to a woman's death early or late in pregnancy or after giving birth.&#10;&#10;In Indiana, the gerrymandered GOP Statehouse supermajority is said to be considering denying women those three reasons for abortion. If so, they'd be saying that they'd like women to face those risks without having any choice of terminating pregnancy.&#10;&#10;The gerrymandered supermajority means that the Indiana GOP will likely make its decision without even conversing with Democratic lawmakers, and probably without public hearings. They would consider themselves wise enough to make these life-and-death judgments for others.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>&quot;That would have been a good time for us to take out everything from the Constitution that was put there to protect slavery, and when you look . . what you will see is practically the whole thing is all about slavery and about protecting the rights of people to own other people.&quot;&#10;&#10;That's at 13:05 in the podcast.

			<description>Tucker Carlson is now casually throwing around the word “Stalinist” in his Fox show’s propaganda.&#10;Wikipedia: “In 1934, Stalin used the murder of Sergey Kirov as a pretext to launch the Great Purge, in which about a million people perished.”&#10;https://t.co/rZs6pq3td4 https://t.co/twxbQjc39Q&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>As alarming and dangerous as this kind of video is, calling audience members “a pathetic mediocrity” or “deplorables” is poisoned rhetoric and poisoned thinking. https://t.co/LcZJjwIB69&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Parallel to the collapse of Iron Curtain countries. Corruption goes on and on, but is finally challenged in a way that is visible to a wide audience, people start to know that everyone knows, and the usual institutions decide not to bail out the corrupt leadership as in the past. https://t.co/9KPLAE8Iu3&#10;&#10;Gorbachev made clear that the Soviet army would not come into Czechoslovakia to bail out the flailing hard-liner Communist government, and larger and larger groups of people, hundreds of thousands, were gathering to protest. The facade was crumbling.&#10;&#10;It takes real staying power, master of public discourse, to challenge the illusions of entrenched power, but corruption presents a shell, an illusion, a facade, and it can be undermined by widespread public knowledge. IF THAT can be achieved.&#10;&#10;The January 6th Committee has refused to play a fair number of the stupid games that our media are accustomed to broadcasting. Detailed presentations, at length, well-crafted, two or three times a week to keep in the public eye, mounting in power of the accusations (I'd say).&#10;&#10;It's as if the committee had never heard of sound bites. And yet they lace the presentations with those too.&#10;&#10;Will they succeed? Who knows. But they play a smart game.&#10;&#10;And yes, for crooks, it's the spotlight that bothers them, not the crime. They got over the crime long ago.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@IdentityTheory @baumansbrain Oh, that Stern poem “The Dancing” . . . He read those last few lines so slowly here once, and all the things of those last few lines hovered and pulsed larger and larger in the room as their names were unfolding, and even, somehow, just before.&#10;&#10;</description>
