			<description>&lt;p&gt;@RayBoomhower My takeaway from the first half of Norman Mailer’s novel was that whoever had the rank to lead a patrol out into the jungle on Guadalcanal would soon be dead. The book taught that lesson repeatedly, if I remember correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Trump asked for military parades. One general&amp;#39;s reply: ‘I actually grew up in Portugal. Portugal was a dictatorship — and parades were about showing the people who had the guns. And in this country, we don’t do that. It’s not who we are.’ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4gZnEyMEEL&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4gZnEyMEEL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;When Twitter reveals the algorithm by which Trending lists are compiled, then I will take them seriously as news. Until then, I will think of them as marketing and as corporate manipulation--that is, as serious in a different way. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/KUszyH41Qm&quot;&gt;https://t.co/KUszyH41Qm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Done right, stories on radio rev up a listener&amp;#39;s imagination. Suspense works beautifully, too. When a yellow wasp lands on the infant&amp;#39;s cheek and begins to clean its forelegs one against the other, you feel the peril.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Most radio programming tosses those resources out the window. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/CtqM73fjEc&quot;&gt;https://t.co/CtqM73fjEc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
