			<description>&quot;The first thing I’ll usually do is...ask the students to propose question or issues that we want to be sure to address. I’ll stand at the board and record these. The point is to make sure that the talking I do [addresses concerns] they’ve actually had.&quot; https://t.co/RsloTtyN3z&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>“Stevens captures how the Republican Party spent decades cultivating grievances that it didn’t plan to do anything about, while Miller captures the consequent emotional valence, with its ‘unseriousness and cruelty,’” writes @JenSzalai. https://t.co/NRST6j0GGU&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I asked at the front desk. The person there said that Martin's does not have any policy about bringing guns into the store. Since then I have been thinking about changing to another grocery store. https://t.co/3Njtpa8vNt&#10;&#10;My understanding is that a business in Indiana can prohibit customers from bringing in guns if it chooses to do so. I'd like to ask whether @martinsmarkets will make customers safer by doing so?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A few weeks ago at the nearest Martin's grocery store in South Bend a person was walking in the aisles with a handgun in a holster. This made me very uncomfortable. I have no way of knowing the person's intentions or state of mind or even proper gun training. @martinsmarkets&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Carrying and giving birth to a child is difficult, dangerous, and even traumatic. Carrying the child of one's abuser after rape or incest is akin to psychological abuse. Certain medical conditions can lead to a woman's death early or late in pregnancy or after giving birth.&#10;&#10;In Indiana, the gerrymandered GOP Statehouse supermajority is said to be considering denying women those three reasons for abortion. If so, they'd be saying that they'd like women to face those risks without having any choice of terminating pregnancy.&#10;&#10;The gerrymandered supermajority means that the Indiana GOP will likely make its decision without even conversing with Democratic lawmakers, and probably without public hearings. They would consider themselves wise enough to make these life-and-death judgments for others.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>&quot;That would have been a good time for us to take out everything from the Constitution that was put there to protect slavery, and when you look . . what you will see is practically the whole thing is all about slavery and about protecting the rights of people to own other people.&quot;&#10;&#10;That's at 13:05 in the podcast.
