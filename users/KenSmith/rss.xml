			<description>Tucker Carlson spoke not long ago about decent people I know and respect in such a cruel, dismissive, indifferent, incurious way, so that’s one thing. But the propaganda methods he and others employ is the main reason I won’t spend money for cable if it includes Fox News.&#10;&#10;If #defundFoxNews means not having to contribute my money to help pay for political folks masquerading as news people and employing destructive propaganda methods, preferring victory over inquiry and giving honorable conservatives a bad name by association, then I’m in.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you write a thread of tweets and realize, darn, that could be a good blog post, go into Drummer, open your outline, go to the Tools menu, and in the drop-down pick the option to have Drummer call in copies of all the tweets you've posted that day. Then arrange them and revise.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm building an in-Twitter app called SnarkSniffer™ that uses AI to detect tweets or replies that are &amp;gt;65% snark in content. SnarkSniffer™ drops those tweets down to the bottom of your timeline where you'd have to work damn hard to ever find them. Where's my investor?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Some people forget about linking because they think the web is mainly a forum for public speech. “I type and my words go out.” “I persuade. I mock. I drown out other voices.” “I sell my product. I sell myself.”&#10;If things go badly, that may be all that remains of the web someday. https://t.co/LeX4XVCDqi&#10;&#10;There are people who see their commercial or political purposes being served when that happens to the web.&#10;&#10;There are users who have probably never noticed the web behaving any other way.&#10;&#10;And it’s true, we often ignore the webyness of the web. The built-out and still building web of linked meaning. People in public pockets asserting, moment by moment, as best they can, meaningful links between bits of speech, stories, lives, matters of beauty and of urgency.&#10;&#10;And behind the unfolding web of linked meaning, we sometimes glimpse a shadowy social web trying, often failing, to materialize concretely and for a time usefully, creatively endure in our embodied human world.&#10;&#10;The difficulty of this part is a weakness of our tools and culture.&#10;&#10;Maybe it’s also a weakness of our nature a human beings, I don’t know.&#10;&#10;But people who were blogging in the early 2000s remember that folks with a shared topic were sometimes able to build and, even if fitfully, sustain a useful conversation for a good long time.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>An interesting 60 seconds on farmers fostering healthy soil microbes that build drought resilience, and social scientists playing a role in biological science work. It’s frustrating when academics forget easy, powerful links to “read more” pieces, a huge virtue of the web. https://t.co/BQFbWXReEX&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Self before country . . .&#10;In Jeffrey Toobin’s NYT review of the new Bill Barr memoir, another major Republican lets a good chunk of time pass before daring to speak more forthrightly about the Big Guy. https://t.co/hNCEmyhFTe&#10;&#10;Barr’s book title, “One Damn Thing After Another,” is a self-pitying, idea-free synonym for “Sure Was Hard Being Me” . . .&#10;&#10;Ah, Barr’s grim view of the noble calling of public service . . .&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Herodotus expressed a careful formulation about the tragedy of war maybe 2450 years ago, and 50 years ago my uncle, a car mechanic and a veteran of World War II, gave my cousins similar advice.

			<description>Our reclusive neighbor is friendly if YOU start the conversation. On his dog walks, he gives a piece of his mind to owners who let their dog off leash in the schoolyard, and he carries a long yellow whiffle ball bat in case he needs to discourage another dog from approaching.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KevinWagnerPhD I was scrolling down your list of columns, nice to see. I’m always on the lookout for clues to a potent citizens toolkit, beyond voting. Kinds of knowledge, attitudes, skills, tools, types of affiliations and partnerships for creating a civic voice with reach and staying power.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I hope these scholars will write op-eds and record podcasts for wide general audiences about the practical insights that might help us improve the health of our teetering civic institutions. What kind of citizens’ toolkit is called for, eg.? https://t.co/vU4m7macfh&#10;&#10;</description>
