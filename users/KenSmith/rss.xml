			<description>While browsing in the campus bookstore once, back in the years when those words meant something, I looked up and saw one of the elder faculty poets rearranging a shelf of volumes so not the very slender spine but the arty front cover of his own book faced out.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don't mean to idealize the past, since people with a good memory can easily recall no shortage of abominable behavior, but there have been groups of people who have tried to share responsibility for disseminating worthy information online.&#10;&#10;Fifteen or twenty years ago it was commonly understood that a community of bloggers with a shared interest acted like a team of information screeners. When something was published that mattered to fans of their shared topic, someone in the group would notice.&#10;&#10;Having noticed, one or more people would skim or read well, comment shallowly or thoughtfully, add a link, and spread the word in the community. If the thing was really promising, a second wave of readers would build on the early notices with further thoughts of their own.&#10;&#10;There would be arguments of fact and interpretation, and the new item would begin to enter the tested and perhaps taken-for-granted contents of the community's hive mind. It might be improved in the process.&#10;&#10;Being the blogosphere, traces of the shared work would make their way down the many screens into archives, becoming less useful there as days went by. Some people would have been informed and perhaps energized. Maybe they'd try something new out in the world. Or maybe not.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just crept above 32 degrees here in northern Indiana.&#10;Our older neighbor with the big, skinny, long-haired dog ambled by in his winter coat, yellow whiffle ball bat in hand in case any off-leash pups approach. It’s a long story.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@davewiner I won’t argue, but maybe just think aloud for a further moment. I don’t know if people are using the lists feature enough to make it very meaningful for spreading political awareness. How to show people the value of a tool inside Twitter or outside? Still musing…&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>After a beautiful concert, I accidentally insulted the pianist, saying the performance was lovely and so athletic. Disapproval flashed on her face as she repeated the word athletic. (In my defense: there had been some wiping of the brow.) The nearby violinist did not comment. https://t.co/srFJkjS1XB&#10;&#10;I readily confess that I don’t know how to talk about classical music.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TheRaDR I remember my daughter and her friend sitting at the table mocking their junior high health book because they plainly saw how terrified the book/the society was of human bodies. They saw the book twist slyly away from discussing what they cared about. They mocked and mocked it.&#10;&#10;@TheRaDR They saw, on some level, that the society was in the process of abandoning them and betraying them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>&quot;Eventually, even well-meaning journalists and intellectuals became guilty of what he called “the ‘doping’ of excitement”—an artificial incitement of emotion that culminated, inevitably, in mass hatred and fear.&quot;&#10;From &quot;When It’s Too Late to Stop Fascism&quot; https://t.co/RGOyWc70pO&#10;&#10;</description>
