			<description>@davewiner @ReasonedWriting I like the different kinds of outlines and uses being mentioned in this thread. It's starting to feel like we need names for outlines that serve very different uses. Schools used to ask for simple-minded topics listed in a sensible order, maybe with indenting for the details.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting Maybe that simple school outline is a rudimentary planning outline.&#10;&#10;The planning outline @ReasonedWriting describes involves a lot more thought about the relationships in the content. It reflects higher order mental activity and deserves its own name.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting And that sophisticated planning outline starts edging toward writing itself, which if it is carried out in an outliner software tool weaves composing, ordering, and revising together from start to finish. That probably needs a name.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting And a further step is the fine-grained work organizing, finding, revealing the relationship between one sentence and the next, one phrase and the next. That is a refinement of skill and thought that the rudimentary school outline is oblivious to.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting For example, should there be an &quot;and&quot; or a &quot;but&quot; between two adjoining sentences? That's a kind of organizing of thought and argument, but is it useful to think of it as part of the more sophisticated sorts of outlining? I don't honestly know.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting I suppose part of the lesson here is that the best of our #toolsforthought can be used in very rudimentary or very sophisticated ways. Can be built to encourage the one or the other. Can be taught to encourage the one or the other.&#10;&#10;@davewiner @ReasonedWriting ...can be taught SO AS to encourage the one or the other. (correction for clarity)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I spoke in a university class yesterday. One question asked: If we want to have a protest in front of the courthouse tomorrow, would Twitter be the organizing tool to use?&#10;My answer: Probably, no, but maybe, it depends on what kind of web you have in place as a writer.&#10;&#10;If one's online publishing is mainly a monologue, then it's not going to work.&#10;&#10;If you've built a web of readers and writers who engage with each other around a topic, then tapping into that might work.&#10;&#10;Gotta use the keyboard often to make things happen away from the keyboard.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SusanDebraBlum It’s a writing tool where you compose right in the layered outline structure that you establish, flesh out, and revise as you write. The thinking and the outline grow in place together.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Schools used to teach outlining as a way to plan a piece of writing. I tend to use an outline as the actual place where I do the writing, thinking, and revising.&#10;&#10;Not so much for poems, though.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Out by the curb, a city truck with its claw arm just grabbed the washing machine that served this household well since 1994.&#10;At the appliance shop, they shook their heads, saying, yes, they used to make them like that. Machines today, they said, are built to last 6-8 years.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>“The real engine at the heart of broken systems, the most insidious, burrowing thing, isn’t their cruelty: It’s the way power obliterates consequences, the certainty that those responsible, by virtue of how deeply the game is rigged in their favor, will always get away with it.” https://t.co/XDbM8bm0tG&#10;&#10;</description>
