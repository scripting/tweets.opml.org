			<description>@indybend I haven't seen one yet in our area. In St. Louis, there is a bold and explicit sign saying no open carry weapons at one of the regional chain grocery stores.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've been asking our regional Martin's Supermarkets and their owners, SpartanNash, to say whether company policy allows for open carry of weapons by customers in the stores. Somebody had a holstered pistol in our neighborhood store not long ago. No answer after about three weeks.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SBTOutdoors The Chilkoot Trail was very little developed when we walked it. It was easy to go astray, and we did. There was no helicopter to bring a struggling tourist out like we saw in the Grand Canyon a few weeks before.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>In 1973, I spent 50¢ for an old used guidebook to Alaska. I found it for sale on a table of culled books in the entry at the public library. The chapters on southeastern Alaska recommended one remote town’s forest boardwalk.&#10;&#10;The boardwalk, shown in a dim black and white photo (the book was full of these), was described as a scenic shortcut through ferny evergreen forest and wetland to a secluded, pebbly spot along the shore.&#10;&#10;Walking that way in 1974, we found long stretches of its wet planks crumbling into shady, mossy, sodden soil. The purpose of the 11-week trip was to explore the longest possible route from home to a nearby college.&#10;&#10;✅ Route: scenic&#10;✅ Boots: soaked&#10;✅ College: delayed&#10;&#10;Moral of the story: While carrying out research, use caution when consulting older sources.&#10;&#10;</description>
