			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wonder if any #Orwell fans have ever run across the source of a quotation said to be from Orwell that goes, roughly, Far too much writing about rural life is done from the wrong side of a five bar gate. @Noovella&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A courteous person called from the management of Martin&amp;#39;s stores in our area. I believe I summarize accurately this way: If they notice a person with an open carry weapon in the store, and the person does not seem problematic, they do nothing more than quietly observe. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/JDN13zn3dG&quot;&gt;https://t.co/JDN13zn3dG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If the person is challenging or disruptive in some way, staff are trained to call 9-1-1, he said. He said he would pass my concerns up to the higher management, which I guess means SpartanNash.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I told him that Schnucks stores in St. Louis take a stronger approach, and I described the sign posted in the store in Chesterfield, a suburb of St. Louis. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lfT84g1a6E&quot;&gt;https://t.co/lfT84g1a6E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also mentioned the choice a company makes to lay low and do and say nothing on a public issue like this one, vs. being part of the conversation. Do we want weapons going in and out in stores, which are private property? Martin&amp;#39;s/SpartanNash could help lead an area conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I also asked if it mattered that other people might bring them into the conversation even if they choose not to step forward themselves. I mentioned having a voice in regional radio, for example. He said he would pass along his notes to those above him.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll add: when there was an open carry event at a neighborhood store, I mentioned it to the person at the front desk. That person seemed to do nothing and did not look into it. &amp;quot;No policy against it&amp;quot; was all he said. That&amp;#39;s a little different than the phone call suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;My overall impression is that the management person who called me back recognized the complexity of our times, and the company was reluctant to seem political. So I don&amp;#39;t imagine they&amp;#39;ll do anything different, but at least concern has been registered.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Join in, if you live in the region and if you like. Their email link is far-bottom-right on this home page.&#10;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/xgvkQynaaM&quot;&gt;https://t.co/xgvkQynaaM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;IN-2nd Representative @RepWalorski / @JackieWalorski voted today against the Respect for Marriage Act, HR 8404, which protects a person legally married in one state from later being denied marriage rights in another state because of their sex, race, ethnicity, or national origin.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a short bill that anyone can easily read and understand, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/DeJkbRABMO&quot;&gt;https://t.co/DeJkbRABMO&lt;/a&gt;&#10;Roll call vote: &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/UWSxaRLcKD&quot;&gt;https://t.co/UWSxaRLcKD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;No clues yet from Ms. Walorski&amp;#39;s social media or website about the reason for her vote.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But it appears Ms. Walorski would like one state to be able to use reasons of sex, race, ethnicity, or nation origin as valid reasons to challenge the marriage rights of someone living there. Why else vote against? She&amp;#39;s not great at informing voter of her views, beyond slogans.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love decoding blurbs and dodging their hyperboles and satirizing them. I wrote a blurb once that I offer now to any writer vain enough to feel deserving of it:&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These poems will be read in Paradise&#10;as God&amp;#39;s wake-up call all the mornings of eternity.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been asking our regional Martin&amp;#39;s Supermarkets and their owners, SpartanNash, to say whether company policy allows for open carry of weapons by customers in the stores. Somebody had a holstered pistol in our neighborhood store not long ago. No answer after about three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@SBTOutdoors The Chilkoot Trail was very little developed when we walked it. It was easy to go astray, and we did. There was no helicopter to bring a struggling tourist out like we saw in the Grand Canyon a few weeks before.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@HormoneHangover My father told one of his work friends about the trip in my presence the next year as if it was kind of a cool accomplishment, but I&amp;#39;m sure he disapproved of the risk of getting off track in life too. My mother&amp;#39;s view--one could still ask...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1973, I spent 50¢ for an old used guidebook to Alaska. I found it for sale on a table of culled books in the entry at the public library. The chapters on southeastern Alaska recommended one remote town’s forest boardwalk.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The boardwalk, shown in a dim black and white photo (the book was full of these), was described as a scenic shortcut through ferny evergreen forest and wetland to a secluded, pebbly spot along the shore.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Walking that way in 1974, we found long stretches of its wet planks crumbling into shady, mossy, sodden soil. The purpose of the 11-week trip was to explore the longest possible route from home to a nearby college.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;✅ Route: scenic&#10;✅ Boots: soaked&#10;✅ College: delayed&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Moral of the story: While carrying out research, use caution when consulting older sources.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
