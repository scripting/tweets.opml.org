			<description>“Not just reading a lot, but paying attention to the way the sentences are put together, the clauses are joined, the way the sentences go to make up a paragraph.”&#10;(article title is misleadingly narrow about its scope) https://t.co/oUF3tpc8nx&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What does a &quot;like&quot; mean on Twitter?&#10;I'd say it tells the writer, person to person, that I agree. It's mainly a private message because my commitment to the idea is not much visible to others. It's not really taking a public stand. 1/4&#10;&#10;Or if a &quot;like&quot; is meant as a public statement, it's roughly the same as sitting in a dark auditorium politely applauding. Nobody puts much of anything on the line doing that, hardly visible, politely applauding. 2/4&#10;&#10;What does RT mean on Twitter?&#10;&#10;I think it says that I'm willing to stand with this idea and help broadcast it further. I am willing to make myself visible and have at least a bit of a stake in the game. 3/4&#10;&#10;An RT still resides within the ghostly space of Twitter, not necessarily poking myself or anything else into action in the world. But it's meaningfully different from a &quot;like&quot; . . .&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Tucker Carlson spoke not long ago about decent people I know and respect in such a cruel, dismissive, indifferent, incurious way, so that’s one thing. But the propaganda methods he and others employ is the main reason I won’t spend money for cable if it includes Fox News.&#10;&#10;If #defundFoxNews means not having to contribute my money to help pay for political folks masquerading as news people and employing destructive propaganda methods, preferring victory over inquiry and giving honorable conservatives a bad name by association, then I’m in.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you write a thread of tweets and realize, darn, that could be a good blog post, go into Drummer, open your outline, go to the Tools menu, and in the drop-down pick the option to have Drummer call in copies of all the tweets you've posted that day. Then arrange them and revise.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm building an in-Twitter app called SnarkSniffer™ that uses AI to detect tweets or replies that are &amp;gt;65% snark in content. SnarkSniffer™ drops those tweets down to the bottom of your timeline where you'd have to work damn hard to ever find them. Where's my investor?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Some people forget about linking because they think the web is mainly a forum for public speech. “I type and my words go out.” “I persuade. I mock. I drown out other voices.” “I sell my product. I sell myself.”&#10;If things go badly, that may be all that remains of the web someday. https://t.co/LeX4XVCDqi&#10;&#10;There are people who see their commercial or political purposes being served when that happens to the web.&#10;&#10;There are users who have probably never noticed the web behaving any other way.&#10;&#10;And it’s true, we often ignore the webyness of the web. The built-out and still building web of linked meaning. People in public pockets asserting, moment by moment, as best they can, meaningful links between bits of speech, stories, lives, matters of beauty and of urgency.&#10;&#10;And behind the unfolding web of linked meaning, we sometimes glimpse a shadowy social web trying, often failing, to materialize concretely and for a time usefully, creatively endure in our embodied human world.&#10;&#10;The difficulty of this part is a weakness of our tools and culture.&#10;&#10;Maybe it’s also a weakness of our nature a human beings, I don’t know.&#10;&#10;But people who were blogging in the early 2000s remember that folks with a shared topic were sometimes able to build and, even if fitfully, sustain a useful conversation for a good long time.&#10;&#10;</description>
