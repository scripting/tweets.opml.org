			<description>&lt;p&gt;Before the war, my father&amp;#39;s walk home from second grade took him past a little candy shop. Without permission from his parents, he started running a tab there. Eventually, the proprietor stopped by their house to collect. The less sympathetic parent answered the door.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
