			<description>@GoingByRenee I hope to read the nugget poem someday. My wasp poem took about a week, reciting increasingly longer versions to myself on walks.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@GoingByRenee I had a similar thought on a walk one day.  I was carrying our toddler on my arm. She turned her face into the breeze, out of which a wasp materialized, landing on her cheek, and set about cleaning its limbs.&#10;Congratulations from South Bend on the Wolfson news.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>One thing I like about Stewart Lee's comedy is that in showing the corruption and hypocrisy of British society he also gives the live audience ways to see how they too are implicated.&#10;&#10;I rarely notice Stewart Lee attending to U. S. culture or current events in his standup. I think he gains his strength in part from keeping a detailed focus on his own homeland.&#10;&#10;He gives people a lot to imagine as he tells stories. A midnight visit to a cemetery by a vindictive political pundit. Like Bob Newhart, phone calls in which we must fill in what the other person surely said. Sentences he knows we can probably complete for him...&#10;&#10;He grapples with a divided society by telling stories about the divisions but also by noting and playing with the likely divisions present between people there in the theater.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JesseDavidFox @GoodOnePodcast @kvanaren @beckrefting A thought-provoking episode.&#10;I wonder if H. G. would agree that her concept for the piece in development is more “true” than her work on it later on?&#10;The Stewart Lee asides felt rushed. A solid S. L. set list would provoke a good chat. He doesn’t court American fans, though.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Like a dictator, a reckless billionaire is shielded from consequences and liberated from the moral lessons of even the most recent history. By reducing contact with cause and effect, both kinds of leader eventually make themselves monsters and fools.&#10;https://t.co/Pso3X0P2GO&#10;&#10;“Our public sphere is governed by almost entirely unconstrained private power.”&#10;&#10;“Ultimately, private power will always protect private power and not public interests.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Like the noise and neon at a tavern’s open door, a good book invites a reader into playful, risky space. With quibbles or bland approvals, gargoyles or melons, slogans or even telegrams from a region in the mind, a reader may leave a book graffitied like the corner of a booth. https://t.co/KIBxBlBRlT&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I doubt Mr. Musk has the wisdom for the job. I doubt he’s named the social aspects of the problem accurately enough to have a hope of doing well. He seems to borrow social insights, rather than working them up and testing them himself. That’s rote work, not thinking.&#10;&#10;But our society allows billionaires to turn our information and communication systems into their playgrounds, so here we are.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>At the end of every tyranny, a good number of the tyrant's functionaries and servants still walk the hallways of all the country's institutions, whispering to themselves and fingering their prayer beads.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>In the U.S., the facade of democracy remains, but behind it hums the machinery of wealth. Each generation must recapture, protect, and renew the institutions, which are endlessly besieged.&#10;&#10;</description>
