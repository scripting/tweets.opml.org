			<description>Fun in Manhattan—walk the High Line park on the old elevated train tracks between 13th and 30th, say, look over at the very nearby apartments of some affluent folks, see and enjoy the art they’ve got on their walls, and, if you like, judge it. Plus street murals. https://t.co/cwsjxrRxGj&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Don’t be in a hurry to move art into that new art museum. Here’s why:&#10;“Not only does the new $50 million, 63,000-square-foot facility need to acclimatize to protect the priceless collection, it also has to shed the gases from construction materials.”&#10;https://t.co/XkH3y7PAdp&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JohannesGoranss I’d say that the best teachers I had along the MFA pathway were excellent readers who showed us how to read in interesting new ways, making its easier to think about choices we were making in our own work and other choices we might make, and what avenues might open up if we did.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Not sure, but I think Twitter has been changing this setting without asking. Is this a new we-don’t-care-what-you-prefer thing from Twitter?&#10;I didn’t like when Facebook quietly changed this same setting either. Plus “home” masks what it is, which is “We choose what you see.” https://t.co/WQ7QyCvrnY&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SBTOutdoors @SBTribune A permanent tab would help. Category tags cleverly chosen for ongoing and short-term opportunities. A web page just for SBTOutdoors posts, especially if organized by those two categories, and offering county and activity-type tags &amp;amp; tabs. A map with live links to ongoing items.&#10;&#10;@SBTOutdoors @SBTribune It sure would seem like you could sell adds into a specialized SBTOutdoors web page. You could deputize good local writers to submit extra content.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Reading Pauline Kael and @JessHopp lately, marveling at the potent sentences, wondering whose powerful sentences instructed and inspired them as they each began to build their custom writer’s toolkit. Eg., this movie criticism from Kael. Start at 0:50.&#10;https://t.co/d9hzQSk1u3&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It’s an information access problem.&#10;I’d say that @SBTOutdoors posts TWO valuable kinds of information for people who treasure the things of nature in our region.&#10;First, there are very interesting ways to learn and participate _right now_, like this seed-growing example. And… https://t.co/9ZotzIH8pY&#10;&#10;Second, @SBTOutdoors posts excellent introductions to long-term opportunities, like this new-to-many-of-us nature preserve an hour up the shore from here. Two kinds of truly valuable postings for real readers in our region. But then… https://t.co/XZpphMsppG&#10;&#10;On social media, these excellent postings about life in our region are mixed together, and then slip down the screen into the archive. Unless you know to look for a particular posting, a reader can really only wander from screen to screen, an ineffective search method. And…&#10;&#10;If you look for the two kinds of valuable @SBTOutdoors postings (immediate interest, enduring interest) at the @SBTribune website, they are (I’d say) blurred together with each other and also with all the “Lifestyle” articles. Search only helps if you know what’s there. So…&#10;&#10;So, it’s an information access problem.&#10;&#10;The @SBTOutdoors writer performs two kinds of valuable work, and the web publishing tools employed by the newspaper chain are not tuned finely enough to preserve and foreground both the real short and long-term value there. In conclusion…&#10;&#10;Somebody should the newspaper chain’s stockholders they’re missing out on a chance to develop and exploit their product’s real social and economic value.&#10;&#10;Somebody should tell the newspaper chain’s stockholders they’re missing out on a chance to develop and exploit their product’s real social and economic value.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@IUSBennion @jmduffynd1 This looks very good, I look forward to the show. So far I can’t find any active social media accounts or webpages devoted to the project, but if they exist I’d be happy to write about them with links. A web page with a sample curriculum and links addressing op-ed skills, eg.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@vhsvvitch The New Yorker excerpted Kael's review of Godfather (#1) recently in a podcast. What writing! The longer version on their website is also a powerhouse. She wrote a dazzling and damning review of John Wayne's &quot;The Cowboys&quot; movie, I recall. Start at 0:50.&#10;https://t.co/uwGSLyFUsJ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'd be pleased to buy writer @AdamLiptak a cup of coffee if I could ask whether the reporting hints at any influence of money in this NY policy. For-profit prisons, and maybe prisons others too, like to have full rosters and paying customers.&#10;https://t.co/z0a9fXhtE0&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/5 Dad worked for the natural gas company. Once in a while I’d hear him talk about a number called degree days, which comes from a formula that includes the mean monthly temperature.&#10;&#10;2/5 The number of degree days for the town every March for the last decade gives a clue to how much gas the company should have on hand to sell next March.&#10;&#10;3/5 But they’d need an extra, buffer supply of gas, because next March might be colder than other recent years. Each March has its own unpredictable degree day total, when all is said and done.&#10;&#10;4/5 Our local natural gas company stored gas reserves in a porous layer of rock beneath the north side of the metro area. Buy it cheap in the summer, pump it underground, and pump it out later when it's needed.&#10;&#10;5/5 Folks want their houses at 65 F. If the average March temperature is 40, that’s thirty days with a 25 degree heating load. If the average temperature is 15, that’s thirty days with a 50 degree heating load. We start to see why the gas company thinks in terms of degree days.&#10;&#10;The National Weather Service explains the actual calculation of degree days for both cooling and heating.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/V2XCknFYT8&#10;&#10;</description>
