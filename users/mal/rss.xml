			<description>&lt;p&gt;@lai_lette @Starbucks One day I was kinda late and had 2 be gone for some reason so the supervisor was yelling at me to find someone to cover but also start my shift. At that moment the highest guy in charge comes around the corner and I give him a stare. She calls me later saying she’ll find someone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
