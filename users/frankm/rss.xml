			<description>Unlike Axios, I don‚Äôt think Musk‚Äôs desire for Twitter is as a tech mogul, instead his is simply wearing his billionaire hat. I think the wealthy like Musk are concerned about the negative reputation toward and potential cancel culture of the wealthy. ... https://t.co/MoSlL4PwTU&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If Musk wanted to impress me he would get rid of Twitter‚Äôs algorithm completely and revert Twitter to a reverse chronological feed, citing how the algorithm is nothing more than feeding an addiction. We don‚Äôt need to see the algorithm, we need to get ... https://t.co/dvJ9DUYQj5&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>An authoritarin often claims to be the sole person who can make someone or something successful. Private ownership of Twitter by Musk has nothing to really do with democracy. His past record has done nothing for me to trust him.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Musk is now trying to buy Twitter. Imagine he owns Twitter and then runs for President of the United States. Would be forced to divest? A precident was set with Trump.
