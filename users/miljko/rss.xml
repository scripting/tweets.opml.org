			<description>&lt;p&gt;A brilliant, scathing newsletter from Charlie Warzel about the vacuous, information-destroying “business dude lorem ipsum”. There is also, of course, the science dude lorem ipsum and the medicine dude lorem ipsum. Caveat lector. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/MC8fZeS8ez&quot;&gt;https://t.co/MC8fZeS8ez&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/IpyzXjGStq&quot;&gt;https://t.co/IpyzXjGStq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@timtriche Academia itself is doing a fine job of dooming itself and destroying its own credibility. I haven’t considered this aspect of the narrative fallacy but Zeynep nails it. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ggPif7XCy1&quot;&gt;https://t.co/ggPif7XCy1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;For a modern academic to survive, they must master building a narrative around their work. Hence workshops about &amp;quot;scientists as storytellers&amp;quot; and other such anti-skepticism poppycock&#10;You have to make sense, but modus omnibus in rebus. If anything, &amp;quot;just so&amp;quot; stories are a red flag &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qIm2lT3IrO&quot;&gt;https://t.co/qIm2lT3IrO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Reading @EconTalker’s Wild Problems now, and this is as clear of an example as any of the difference between tame and wild domains. Human interactions are more like gene regulatory networks than genes themselves: complex and unpredictable. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/PGi3sknKd0&quot;&gt;https://t.co/PGi3sknKd0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yes! The answer to expensive RCTs is not patching together a Frankenstein&amp;#39;s monster of phase 2 studies, post-hoc Bayesian trawling, &amp;quot;real world&amp;quot; data and machine learning/AI, it is making the thing we know works less expensive. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/cDtD7pRUcJ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/cDtD7pRUcJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trishankkarthik @nntaleb Bingo. Employed doctors are RVU generating machines (and if you needed any more confirmation that medicine is not a science, just look up what &amp;quot;RVU&amp;quot; means). They are also one of the few patient-oriented facets of the system and get the brunt of the hate (being the best paid).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trishankkarthik @nntaleb It&amp;#39;s a high-income, low-wealth profession. Expensive to get into (without state-sponsored higher education at least; thank you, Serbia), doesn&amp;#39;t start paying off until years after graduation (interns/residents earn just slightly above minimum wage)…&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trishankkarthik @nntaleb …then as soon as you start earning six figures you get barraged with offers for &amp;quot;doctors loans&amp;quot; for that Mercedes and 6-bedroom McMansion you fantasized about during 36hr calls.&#10;There would be no medicine if there weren&amp;#39;t for people who actually enjoyed doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@nntaleb To clarify for those whose reading comprehension is as bad as mine: rich at 35 is not a test of intelligence, it is a test of skills &amp;amp; abilities for being Fat Tony. Not everyone’s goal, of course!&#10;Now, if rich at 35 &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; a test of intelligence, doctors would be dumb as rocks.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today in misleading headlines… Though to be fair to FT, authors of the paper were much more relaxed about throwing around arrows of causality in the interview than they were in their own manuscript. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/bkS7Hz6GX0&quot;&gt;https://t.co/bkS7Hz6GX0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@scmarco69 @nntaleb @JordanHedberg @NachoOliveras @EconTalker People who get covid vaccines are older than people who get most other vaccines. Second, covid vaccines have increased scrutiny, so I’d expect more reporting in the same age group. When a 70 y/o nursing home resident dies a week after pneumonia shot no one will report it to VAERS&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@scmarco69 @nntaleb @JordanHedberg @NachoOliveras @EconTalker It’s not the validity of reports that is the issue with VAERS, it is the post hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy. VAERS may be useful for picking up on unique side effects, but for common things like death it is worse than useless.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@nntaleb @JordanHedberg @NachoOliveras @EconTalker In his (Russ Roberts&amp;#39;) defense, he didn&amp;#39;t say that a 30 y/o shouldn&amp;#39;t take the vaccine, rather that it&amp;#39;s hard to have an intuitive grasp of that kind of information.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
