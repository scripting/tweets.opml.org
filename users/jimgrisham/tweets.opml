				<outline text="@AlanaKinrich When the medical treatments were announced (a few weeks back?), it was broadly communicated that those had the most efficacy when treatment was started soon after symptoms first appeared.

Perhaps that subconsciously affected people's risk calculations?" type="tweet" created="Thu, 06 Jan 2022 19:08:25 GMT" tweetId="1479167991455662083" urltweet="https://twitter.com/jimgrisham/status/1479167991455662083" inReplyToId="1478905701011374081" tweetUserName="jimgrisham" />
				<outline text="@SHIELDIllinois This is a saliva-based PCR test, developed last year by the @UofIllinois, with results available in about 24 hours.

(It's great for young children who might not otherwise tolerate someone sticking a swab up their nose.)

Appointments are available, but they also accept walk-ins." type="tweet" created="Thu, 06 Jan 2022 19:02:26 GMT" tweetId="1479166484719058948" urltweet="https://twitter.com/jimgrisham/status/1479166484719058948" inReplyToId="1478444259388891139" tweetUserName="jimgrisham" >

				<outline text="@DanielleAdair4 @SHIELDIllinois They show up on the map (at least when using a computer browser; not sure about mobile ones), when clicking on one of the 'pins'.

No login required.

There's also a link in each pop-up for directions to the location and another link for scheduling." type="tweet" created="Thu, 06 Jan 2022 18:59:46 GMT" tweetId="1479165813529759744" urltweet="https://twitter.com/jimgrisham/status/1479165813529759744" inReplyToId="1479147879776276486" tweetUserName="jimgrisham" />

				<outline text="@AstridBears @kadska @erinbiba Tuna in oil works too. If cans aren’t completely full, they’re probably less likely to burst when stored on their sides (e.g. down with the spare tire in the trunk - lots of space underneath).

Salt, fat, (and maybe sugar?) will all lower the freezing point." type="tweet" created="Wed, 05 Jan 2022 04:49:21 GMT" tweetId="1478589412577587202" urltweet="https://twitter.com/jimgrisham/status/1478589412577587202" inReplyToId="1478523623803527168" tweetUserName="jimgrisham" />

				<outline text="@dampscribbler @thejesusofnasty @DanaSchwartzzz At least one WWII ‘Liberty Ship’ snapped into two whilst pier-side due to cold water… so yeah, that checks.

(there was probably a minor flaw in the crystalline structure of the iron that existed from the time that pan was cast - years of temperature fatigue took their toll)" type="tweet" created="Mon, 03 Jan 2022 16:38:30 GMT" tweetId="1478043098823417860" urltweet="https://twitter.com/jimgrisham/status/1478043098823417860" inReplyToId="1478039803941691392" tweetUserName="jimgrisham" >

Both people wearing surgical masks vs. cloth doubles it again." type="tweet" created="Sun, 02 Jan 2022 09:01:46 GMT" tweetId="1477565773736464389" urltweet="https://twitter.com/jimgrisham/status/1477565773736464389" inReplyToId="1430877311776313346" tweetUserName="jimgrisham" />
