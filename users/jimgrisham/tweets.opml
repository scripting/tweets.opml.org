				<outline text="@Ed_Fryer @PhillipsPOBrien They’ll probably start converting some roads to multi-gauge (i.e. 3 rails) as needed. Then, the existing equipment can be continued to be used.

(The press release didn’t contain many details; the indictment may contain more information for the curious.)" rawText="@drb0n3z @mattblaze It could have been data from his memory that he typed manually into an email.

				<outline text="@Mr_A_McSquiffy @PhillipsPOBrien @KpsZSU Exactly!

Too often we get stuck in an either/or kind of debate.

If _our_ country was being attacked, and friendly aliens offered us the use of their fleet of armed ships, would we just shrug and say “nah, that looks too hard to learn - we’ll stick with our F-22s and trenches”?" rawText="@Mr_A_McSquiffy @PhillipsPOBrien @KpsZSU Exactly!
