			<description>@VAFramer @ToriGlass @jonsteingard Probably for a similar reason to how they justify not being able to always perfectly replicate food in that fictional universe: https://t.co/NNMiagmmCI&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ReflectiveKen @AuthorConfusion @jonsteingard I thought the (fictional) description was more akin to a blender or a parallel-to-serial encoder;&#10;i.e. the matter isn’t converted to energy, but rather sent in a very tight stream (as subatomic or perhaps quantum particles?) and then reassembled (much as a 3d printer does).&#10;&#10;@ReflectiveKen @AuthorConfusion @jonsteingard (tight enough to pass through the mostly empty space in otherwise ‘solid’ walls, etc.)&#10;&#10;If it was purely an energy-based copy, you could always reassemble the new version (and verify accuracy) before destroying the old - killing nearly all plots involving transporter ‘accidents’!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@octavia324 @missykender @bluebirdpoopies @OneSquirreliest @KevOnStage The main Seattle branch uses the same cards as the other many neighborhood branches of the #SeattlePublicLibrary (@SPLBuzz).&#10;[While Seattle has a separate system than the rest of King County (@KCLS), the two systems offer free reciprocity.]&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics {it seems the graduate student and his honest-to-a-fault fiancée, after actually saying it out loud, realized what they were suggesting and _did not_ actually steal any wood}&#10;But yes, sadly, those #TragedyOfTheCommons results are …common; see: #ClimateChange &amp;amp; #CampaignFinance.&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics It’s horribly troubling for society.&#10;&#10;The vast majority of people, in any large group, are honest and well-meaning, or believe they are.&#10;&#10;⚠️ The highly-evolved instincts that served our distant hunter-gather ancestors well haven’t had very long to adapt to life in huge societies.&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics Apologies for carrying on like that.&#10;#SharingIsCaring? 🤷&#10;&#10;~~&#10;&#10;For anyone persistent enough to see this, a reward to blow your mind for the weekend:&#10;&#10;Part 1 by @cgpgrey (4 min, 57 sec): https://t.co/3CrgqQXodr&#10;&#10;Part 2 by @Kurz_Gesagt (6 min, 27 sec): https://t.co/WjXYYh38Y2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lift_Our_Voice Exactly.&#10;Make new friends.&#10;Ask if they are registered to vote; if not, offer to help them to find out how to register or request mail/#absentee ballots.&#10;Offer to walk with them to the polls, or help to arrange rides for those who need it.&#10;Election day should be a party!&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice Most humans desire #agency, but many of us either don’t know it is possible or have given up seeking it.&#10;&#10;Research has shown that even non-partisan messages such as “4 out of 5 of your neighbors voted in the last election” can be highly motivational!&#10;&#10;*Use only real stats, obvs!&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice #SocialProof&#10;&#10;“Japan in the Covid-19 pandemic, where they looked at the willingness … to wear a mask, and they looked at a variety of possible reasons: …&#10;&#10;The only one that made any difference was the number of people they saw wearing masks.”&#10;&#10;https://t.co/HT4K6OBr04&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice One more story from that @Freakonomics Radio podcast episode:&#10;&#10;“If a lot of people are doing it, it must be the right thing to do.&#10;&#10;I had a graduate student who was coming to work with me from California, and he and his fiancée — the woman he described as the single most …”&#10;&#10;1/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics “… honest person he had ever known in his life; she wouldn’t borrow a paper clip that she did not return — they decided,&#10;&#10;‘Well, let’s go see the Petrified Forest in northern Arizona on our way to work with Cialdini.’&#10;&#10;And they were standing in front of a sign …”&#10;&#10;2/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics “…at the entrance that said,&#10;&#10;‘So many people are stealing petrified wood and crystals that the forest is endangered.’&#10;&#10;Some kind of language like that. And my graduate student, while he was still reading the sign, felt this elbow in his ribs, and …”&#10;&#10;3/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics “…his invariably honest fiancée said,&#10;&#10;‘We better get ours, too.’&#10;&#10;(Stephen) DUBNER: ‘Before it’s all gone.’”&#10;&#10;~&#10;&#10;(That episode also has great stories about the #CubanMissileCrisis, online product reviews, #PsychologicalReactance, and _many_ other topics.)&#10;&#10;4/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics A final quote from social psychologist @RobertCialdini:&#10;&#10;“Thinking is hard work.&#10;&#10;Especially in an environment of such challenge and change and overload.&#10;&#10;So, it is simpler and easier to use our shortcuts.&#10;&#10;…”&#10;&#10;1/2&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics @RobertCialdini “…&#10;&#10;Most of the time, if they’re well-founded, they steer us correctly.&#10;&#10;But some percentage of the time, they steer us very poorly.”&#10;&#10;2/2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lift_Our_Voice For _each_ citizen that moves to a new state/area: perhaps they can befriend and convince, on average, _at least_ one new non-voting neighbor to actually vote within the first few months.&#10;(The DoD would call this a #ForceMultiplier tactic.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>‘The missions into Russia are “not a big secret,” said Shaman.&#10;“Sometimes it happens on a helicopter. Sometimes we go in by foot. Most of the times we’re able to locate the good entry point to fly in or to walk on foot into Russia and then afterwards, what can I say?”’ https://t.co/QdcJgq3LXx&#10;&#10;</description>
