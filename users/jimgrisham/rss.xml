			<description>@TheRealJimSanto @AndrewDesiderio It happens all the time, for both procedural motions and also for final confirmations. (Additionally, sometimes Senators just get too tired to argue and want to go home/fundraise.)&#10;Another benefit: with voice votes no one has to be on the record.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@smileyherring @MarkHertling Someone elsewhere stated it was some sort of NATO communications system? that wasn’t compatible with Ukrainian systems.&#10;They surely got whatever they needed (perhaps with the Canadian M777s) to utilize those advanced shells.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@kwestin Traditional RF proximity unlocking systems, as used in many “push-to-start” auto systems are vulnerable to the same class of attacks.&#10;If you don’t have to press a button in the remote, it’s vulnerable.&#10;Same thing with RFID (e.g. HID branded building access cards) systems, btw.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ophardy @igorsushko The bombers normally never leave Russian airspace.&#10;Some of the incoming missiles are being launched from from ships in the Caspian Sea, many hundreds of kilometers behind the border.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@FriedrichFiles @ThomasCatt1812 @amandalhu It can save tons on energy costs, though.&#10;For example, if you currently heat or cool your restaurant, any existing ventilation (e.g. bathrooms, kitchen, hvac) is dumping money into the outdoors. Much of this can be recovered.&#10;Economies of scale will eventually make commonplace.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Indeed: “a time” could easily be several _centuries_ or more (see: slaves of African descent), but no coercion can last forever.&#10;[I often wonder what the root causes of Chinese fear (other than centuries of pre-modern regional instability) is regarding those groups.]&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Indeed.&#10;Governments only exist with the consent of the governed, and societies only exist as long as their members stay together.&#10;Coercive force (physical, psychologic, economic, etc.) has sometimes worked to hold groups together, but only for a time.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux (That was not my intention but I understand that is how my comments may have been seen.)&#10;My opinion is irrelevant yet I have appreciated hearing yours.&#10;(Determining if there is a ‘right’ answer to that question seems quite academic as long as others have opposing views.)&#10;1/2&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux One must first agree with the premise of a question.&#10;&#10;As you said earlier, nearly anything can be turned into an advantage long-term.&#10;&#10;Since all diversity cannot be eliminated long-term, it seems prudent for societies to identify and mitigate the root causes of its problems.&#10;&#10;2/2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Perhaps!&#10;Political borders are complex social constructs and sometimes deserve to be changed.&#10;The ‘state’ is also a construct. An outcome can be simultaneously detrimental to a ‘state’ and advantageous to the (former) citizens of that ‘state’. The inverse may be more common.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@FriedrichFiles @ThomasCatt1812 @amandalhu Units called ‘Heat Recovery Ventilators’ and ‘Energy Recovery Ventilators’ are available that allow ventilation with negligible increases in energy usage by transferring heat (#HRV) or heat+humidity (#ERV) between the stale and fresh air.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Something can be a short-term weakness while being a long-term strength.&#10;If I am overwhelmed at work, I can hire an apprentice. I may be at a short-term disadvantage by having to devote time to training, but in the long-term this type of investment clearly is a winner.&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Political borders cannot survive forever unchanged.&#10;&#10;If the ‘internal division’ from your hypothetical is problematic &amp;amp; persists for decades, perhaps the borders need to be updated.&#10;&#10;Groups can disband, groups can coalesce. Groups can migrate.&#10;&#10;Nature shows this on many scales.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Politically it’s a mess. That’s not organic, though.&#10;Having travelled _many_ places here, I’ve found people in each town are overwhelmingly just concerned with surviving.&#10;The economic inequality and ‘shocks’ (or fear thereof) cause the political strife, not the inverse.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Whether it is a strength, a weakness, or neither/both seems to be a distraction (and perhaps unanswerable in a general sense for now).&#10;As with anything, one can aim to embrace beneficial factors and mitigate non-beneficial ones.&#10;In which circumstances was diversity a weakness?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien The facts on the ground are often quite different from the political and media discourse.&#10;(if racial discontent was ubiquitous it wouldn’t, by definition, be ‘news’)&#10;People have far more in common than not, and most will admit that in private conversation.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Race, after all, is a social construct.&#10;&#10;Racism generally appears in places where people do not feel secure, either physically, socially, or economically.&#10;&#10;A century ago, Italians were seen as the ‘other’ in the US. Any differences can be scary, especially when times are tough.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien If the poor people of &amp;lt;insert group here&amp;gt; are scary, but a wealthy and well educated member of that same group is not…&#10;&#10;… then the root fear is likely not of some grouping of people based on arbitrary characteristics, but rather due to the underlying assumptions being assigned.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Anti-migrant sentiments occur when political power or financial power is threatened.&#10;&#10;To a hypothetical nation of 100 million people, an influx of 1 million migrants (1%) is not a fear of (e.g.) ‘brown people’ but of ‘poor people’.&#10;&#10;Would they reject 20 million rich migrants?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux That there are only ‘two sides’ to any issue is a very dangerous mindset.&#10;(that’s not an indictment of your comment, just a general statement)&#10;Nature is probably the best example of ‘diversity’ in action (in terms of ‘evidence’), though.&#10;Consider the Irish potato famine.&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Since diversity in any complex system cannot ever be completely and sustainably eliminated, the most logical course is to embrace (or at least accept) that eventually.&#10;&#10;Any challenges can then be addressed head-on and based on their merits (rather than trying to assign blame).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien The ‘cultural narratives’ of the 90s and 2000s weren’t healthy, either.&#10;The majority of the politically powerful grew up in time where resources were abundant, education was nearly free, and yet were unhappy.&#10;It’s not that I’m saying they were spoiled, over-entitled, children… https://t.co/SdPk3fYzTv&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JohnHBillings @EliNew18 @Viking95 @BretDevereaux The Roman Empire could also be a vastly different society from one century to the next.&#10;Perhaps time/fate caught up with them, or perhaps by the end they lost sight of some of the qualities that made them once so adaptable.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EliNew18 @Viking95 @BretDevereaux Give us a generation and check back, please.&#10;The elders who remembered the hardships of hunger and war are gone.&#10;Much of the current ‘ruling class’ matured during a time of great abundance and are now somewhat set in their ways of thinking.&#10;&#10;</description>
