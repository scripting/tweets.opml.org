			<description>@volt3d @kemal_115 Perhaps also networked, distributed, automated, short/medium range systems that can be numerous and nimble.&#10;Something like Aegis radar + RIM-116 missiles, but mounted on mobile light-armored vehicles.&#10;https://t.co/UCZ76SbMza&#10;&#10;@volt3d @kemal_115 You’re right… CAMM / Sky Sabre looks promising as well!&#10;&#10;https://t.co/IJEVaXPrwF&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Independent Not exploded or un-exploded, just lethal war trash.&#10;It’s an Uragen-type carrier for cluster bombs, seen here crashed after its payload was ejected:&#10;(the booster section crashed elsewhere; you wouldn’t want the kinetic energy of either landing on your head) https://t.co/jP4fhJFlVJ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TimandHonor @LovedayM The Uragen 9M27K (the carrier missile, not the individual ‘passenger’ cluster bombs) appears to have just such a nosecone: https://t.co/jP4fhJFlVJ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SandwaterLake @igorsushko It also comes off like there is a Putin apologist in that intelligence chain.&#10;If Putin isn’t getting accurate information, that’s his own fault.&#10;Perhaps he should resign, move to a village, and re-connect with his people.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@tipesca @Megamin91343928 @InnaSovsun Yeah, the playground clearly wasn’t the target. (It was nearby, though.)&#10;The caption may have been misleading, but the photo appears authentic.&#10;— — —&#10;Bottom line: there’s too much collateral damage in any war.&#10;Perhaps our grandchildren will be more peaceful than us.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AshDom12 @HaywardScoreCEO It would be constantly alarming?&#10;(Seriously, though, I heard Japan? had been using inexpensive CO2 sensors as a proxy for measuring occupancy + fresh air exchange rate to some good effect.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@WSJ @Csdk1111 Maybe just grant asylum where it is warranted and the number of ‘illegal crossings’ will be naturally limited?&#10;More workers = more taxable income = continued economic growth = everyone wins.&#10;Not everything is a zero-sum game.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@tipesca @Megamin91343928 @InnaSovsun It looks like a booster-stage rocket casing, as was seen with their cluster bomb missiles - the explosive payload likely continued onward towards its target with a second/third stage rocket motor.&#10;The minimal damage shown is solely due to the kinetic energy upon impact.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@cmvalentineb @ClaireBurdett @ninuxch @DirkStrongtall @ndcarson @kathrinpassig @teh_skullz @TrentTelenko Improved transmission capacity can mitigate much of the need for batteries, and will be needed anyway when fusion power becomes available in the 2050-2090 time frame.&#10;Spending the next 50 years improving grid infrastructure worldwide will pay dividends for our grandchildren.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TrentTelenko Does that not keep for more than one season if not planted now? (honest question - I’ve never farmed anything)&#10;Couldn’t at least some ‘EU-compatible’ seed corn that was needed be imported from elsewhere in the EU (or even from Russia, as part of some sort of reparations scheme)?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TrentTelenko It’s easy forget how large Ukraine actually is…&#10;… isn’t it plausible that the number of acres of farmland never even within shouting distance of military vehicles is at least an order of magnitude larger than the number _directly_ touched by forces from either side?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TrentTelenko There was reporting somewhere recently claiming Ukraine had stored wheat capacity to match last year’s export, and are actively shipping it via rail to Europe.&#10;As long as some supply lines remain open, they should be able to re-import some of that, right?&#10;&#10;@TrentTelenko If farmers worldwide did really plant extra wheat earlier this year due to high futures pricing, there’s a risk of a post-harvest oversupply, killing global wheat prices.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Did you or a friend see shocking news?&#10;Please sleep on it, or at least do some fact-checking, prior to sharing.&#10;“The war shortfall is 0.9% of the global wheat crop!&#10;Not 25%!” https://t.co/hl3IgVZpgS&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jrochest @mvhElmore @kamilkazani It’s an interesting strategy for purely industrial substations, though.&#10;Anti-drone defenses, in the rare places they exist, might ignore drones too small to carry significant explosives, for example, but if consumer-level drones could do something like this…&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@GwizoKeith @TrentTelenko Can you imagine how it would be received, during the war, if some Russian low-level enough to read even ‘suggested’ advice from the ‘West’?&#10;Best-case scenario is he’d be laughed off, or his superior would be punished for parroting propaganda.&#10;Russian military doesn’t have NCOs. https://t.co/471PzADIQM&#10;&#10;@GwizoKeith @TrentTelenko The Ukrainians aren’t giving up.&#10;&#10;If they were going to bow to a bully, they would have done so long before the indiscriminate shelling began.&#10;&#10;Russia will _eventually_ be partitioned by politics or a civil war. #Tatarstan&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@GwizoKeith @TrentTelenko Which project managers are going to arrange that?&#10;The ones who either didn’t exist or weren’t empowered to get things done before the invasion?&#10;It’s too late now to stop the bleeding, regardless of the money or bodies thrown at their quagmire.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Ian_Whitchurch @philologon @TrentTelenko If society is willing to support mobilization over short-term profits, absolutely!&#10;Arguably, that should have happened (with a WWII-level of funding, urgency, and shared sacrifice) with COVID-19 testing and vaccine production, but it didn’t.&#10;I sincerely hope we do better now.&#10;&#10;</description>
