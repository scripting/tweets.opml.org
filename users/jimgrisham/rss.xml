			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If Russia successfully breaks into pieces, the Basques might be inspired.&#10;Perhaps the Scots.&#10;Perhaps the Kurds.&#10;Andalusians. Balochs. Hmong. Palestinians. Rohingya. Uyghurs. Zulu.&#10;There will be an _enormous_ amount of elite pressure (worldwide) to prevent that idea spreading.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock The collapse of the USSR was rather orderly compared to what _could_ happen to the Russian Federation, though.&#10;If the Russian economy collapses before the government does, perhaps the chaos following the fall of Rome might be a better precedent?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Choosing unity under fire is a testament to the wisdom of your countrymen.&#10;[All humans are cousins to one another, of course; in future centuries, I sincerely hope the concept of ‘they’ (‘war’, too) becomes an anachronism.]&#10;The world is with your people.&#10;Слава Україні!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@britinvan @chumak_iryna @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock … but perhaps in different combinations today, due to changed demographics (some forced) and better communication.&#10;Unanswered question for future historians: were smaller nations preferable to larger ones?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Putin has managed to keep Russia together so far; whoever comes next may not be able to manage such an ‘empire’.&#10;Will that ‘siloviki’ survive, and will they still get paid? If so, will someone pay their salary from their own pockets? Will the ‘siloviki’ splinter or stay united?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock I agree.&#10;Outside of large cities, though, what if they didn’t _have_ to fight? If there is no one to fight against?&#10;If your town is a minority in a political subdivision, and the government collapses, then your town is a majority in your town.&#10;Perhaps your town becomes Monaco?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Parts of the USA would probably be better off as part of Canada, others as part of Mexico.&#10;Nation-states are such a recent contrivance, in terms of the history of human civilization. Their existence (and longevity) a thousand years from now may just be an interesting footnote.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock No, you’re exactly right. Ukraine has a better identity _because_ they were invaded.&#10;It’s still a social construct, but it’s a strong one.&#10;(In an alternate universe without Russia, Ukraine may have ultimately chosen to exist as several friendly neighbors instead of one whole.)&#10;&#10;@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Why is the United States one nation while Europe is many?&#10;&#10;It could have been 2, 7, 13, or 50, perhaps with a EU-like trade union.&#10;&#10;One might argue it’s just a good origin story (fighting against a common enemy) and a quirk of history / geography.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If it fractures into a hundred pieces,  nothing stops some of those pieces from later combining in different ways.&#10;One can’t have a gold watch without first having a supernova.&#10;I imagine other governments would fight that precedent; power fears “political self-determination”.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock With no army, what (besides economic limitations) would prevent some of those displaced groups from returning to their ancestral lands?&#10;Perhaps the oligarchs, warlords, and other elites will all band together under a common banner, but it seems at least as likely they would not.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Yes, their ability to protest _within the system_ was intentionally and systematically removed.&#10;If the entire national political system collapses (not predicting that, at all, but it is a possibility), internal borders lose much of their significance.&#10;2 pieces, or 28, or 80?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Agreed.&#10;Normally force is needed to overcome force, yes, but what realistic force of the state will be left after the current misadventures? https://t.co/jZulDklg1Y&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock “National identity” is sort of like fiat currency… it only has value as long as enough of the citizens believe it does.&#10;In such a culturally heterogeneous (and expansive) nation as the Russian Federation, that identity can collapse just like an unstable currency.&#10;Quickly.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KiarKini @chumak_iryna @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock The Russian ‘Federation’ can fail, but the pieces could still prosper.&#10;(Agreed that a failed, but intact, Russia would be a disaster on many levels.)&#10;Self-determination is an essential human right.&#10;Central management from Moscow has failed _multiple_ times over the centuries.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Putin is not as strong as he once was.&#10;He allegedly has health issues.&#10;The republics don’t have to beat him any more, they just need to plan and wait.&#10;With the current economic issues (and the army decimated), the resulting power vacuum will cause regions to just drift away.&#10;&#10;@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock What holds this vast, culturally diverse, federation together?&#10;&#10;Is it just fear*, tradition, and inertia? Perhaps a little economics? Will that suffice for the next few months/years/decades?&#10;&#10;What will Russia look like in 2122?&#10;&#10;(* of Putin, the police, the army, or the unknown)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@sppeterson @francis_scarr The more complex a system, the more humans try to simplify it (for often very understandable reasons).&#10;This unfortunately tends to strip out redundancy and causes the system to become more brittle / less adaptive.&#10;Which types of present-day societies will still exist in 2122?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DublinReader @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Exactly!&#10;Complex systems, whether social, economic, biologic, or technologic (e.g. the Challenger disaster) often fail in ways impossible to predict (even given perfect info).&#10;Since they have in-built redundancies, when they do fail, they tend to fail in a catastrophic manner.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If the current Russian government ever does collapse, it likely won’t happen all at once.&#10;Small things, such as media control, will begin to fail first.&#10;This could be either through dissent/sabotage, neglect, or lack of attention as leaders are distracted by more urgent issues.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bbcanuck23 @TrentTelenko Yes. They can be successful in two ways:&#10;1. deforming or knocking off course to minimize damage, like a block in Karate or Judo🥋&#10;2. causing explosive rounds to detonate a few milliseconds early, reducing their ability to function as designed --&amp;gt; reduced chance of penetration&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@johngineer @TrentTelenko Vendors have an incentive to over-state capabilities.&#10;Militaries have an incentive to under-state capabilities (or to over-state for deterrence, a-la Reagan’s ‘SDI’/‘Star Wars’ or DPRK and Russia).&#10;🤷&#10;Actual field performance depends on many factors, and is likely classified.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bbcanuck23 @TrentTelenko They are single-use small ‘pads’ or bags seen tiled on the perimeter of some tanks.&#10;Filled with explosives (a ‘shape charge’, I imagine, to direct energy outward), they explode when penetrated by a projectile (or jet from an anti-tank ‘HEAT’ round) to try to deflect the attack.&#10;&#10;</description>
