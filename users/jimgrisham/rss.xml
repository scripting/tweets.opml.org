			<description>@sppeterson @francis_scarr The more complex a system, the more humans try to simplify it (for often very understandable reasons).&#10;This unfortunately tends to strip out redundancy and causes the system to become more brittle / less adaptive.&#10;Which types of present-day societies will still exist in 2122?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DublinReader @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Exactly!&#10;Complex systems, whether social, economic, biologic, or technologic (e.g. the Challenger disaster) often fail in ways impossible to predict (even given perfect info).&#10;Since they have in-built redundancies, when they do fail, they tend to fail in a catastrophic manner.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@sppeterson @francis_scarr Even a cabal only has so much bandwidth, especially when multiple crises are occurring simultaneously.&#10;Normal human limitations apply.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If the current Russian government ever does collapse, it likely won’t happen all at once.&#10;Small things, such as media control, will begin to fail first.&#10;This could be either through dissent/sabotage, neglect, or lack of attention as leaders are distracted by more urgent issues.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bbcanuck23 @TrentTelenko Yes. They can be successful in two ways:&#10;1. deforming or knocking off course to minimize damage, like a block in Karate or Judo🥋&#10;2. causing explosive rounds to detonate a few milliseconds early, reducing their ability to function as designed --&amp;gt; reduced chance of penetration&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@johngineer @TrentTelenko Vendors have an incentive to over-state capabilities.&#10;Militaries have an incentive to under-state capabilities (or to over-state for deterrence, a-la Reagan’s ‘SDI’/‘Star Wars’ or DPRK and Russia).&#10;🤷&#10;Actual field performance depends on many factors, and is likely classified.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bbcanuck23 @TrentTelenko They are single-use small ‘pads’ or bags seen tiled on the perimeter of some tanks.&#10;Filled with explosives (a ‘shape charge’, I imagine, to direct energy outward), they explode when penetrated by a projectile (or jet from an anti-tank ‘HEAT’ round) to try to deflect the attack.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@johngineer @TrentTelenko You’re probably thinking of the Excalibur (they’re only getting a small number of those), but with drone ISR repeated M795 hits can still be quite precise.&#10;If the get ahold of some of the precision course-correcting fuze attachments, all the better.&#10;“More bang for the buck.”™&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@PLCount @1twittafae @kevin_cracknell @TheStudyofWar … and even those shaded areas may or may not be occupied by any significant force, depending on the day.&#10;Due to heavy use of ranged weaponry (‘long-range fires’, as the kids say), one would have to shrink nearly all of those borders by some number of kilometers to find troops.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@1twittafae @PLCount @kevin_cracknell @TheStudyofWar … that doesn’t mean Russia controls the other 90%, of course.&#10;Some percentage is surely actively contested and not under the exclusive control or either side.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EntierSpectre @kamilkazani It’s nice to know that some nations prioritize infrastructure.&#10;Since road maintenance (or any maintenance - see also urban trash pickup contracts) isn’t ‘sexy’, and since government (and the press) generally don’t tend to have experience in those fields, graft is seldom noticed.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@kamilkazani Other possibilities?&#10;- Z is a ‘sharp’, ‘warlike’ shape with no soft edges like in ‘з’. Likewise with ‘V’/‘В’.&#10;History: “Only the form ꙁ was used in the oldest ustav writing.”&#10;“The shape of the letter originally looked similar to a Greek Zeta with a tail on the bottom (ꙁ).”&#10;&#10;@kamilkazani … and if one is trying to ‘restore the glory (and lands)’ of a former empire, using antique/anachronistic forms of symbols or letters may seem logical to them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@UAWeapons In addition, by not sending those expensive electronic modules, the ‘book cost’ of the transfer was likely reduced, which allowed the USG to instead send additional munitions and supplies within the current approved budget authority.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bear_Faced @ClavdiaMinor @sentdefender The compartment where the fire victims were found was not nearly completely flooded, right?&#10;As memory serves, there were three(?) major fatal events (the initial explosion, secondary explosions several minutes later (that killed most crew), and only hours later the fire).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@moscow_english @sentdefender Fair. 😉&#10;Besides, I’m sure their warships are as well maintained as their tanks.&#10;(I was always _amazed_, given the large volumes of seawater involved, whenever there was news of a submarine-submarine collision.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@moscow_english @sentdefender It’s not _that_ small of an area.&#10;They’d all fit in a large-sized harbor.&#10;The Black Sea is has a _surface area_ of 168,500 mi², equal area to a square 410 miles on each side.&#10;(i.e. 436,400 km², equal area to a square 660 km on each side)&#10;Also, submarines operate in 3D space.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bear_Faced @ClavdiaMinor @sentdefender Yes, but if poor maintenance practices had not lead to that fire (oily bilge water causing self-ignition of chemical oxygen generator cartridges, if I recall correctly), those crew members could have survived until rescued.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bill_Abely @brandonazheng @Noahpinion “They” has long been a default when it is not known what pronoun to use; e.g.:&#10;A: “Someone broke into my car last night.”&#10;B: “That’s horrible! Did they steal anything valuable?”&#10;A: “No, that almost makes it worse. They broke two windows for nothing!”&#10;B: “I hope they get caught!”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 I’m sure it can be flown in to airports without pipelines, but no idea what that adds to the cost.&#10;Does anyone know how western USA airports (especially in land-locked ones) get their fuel deliveries?&#10;Thinking of places such as MSP, SLC, DEN, BOI…&#10;… oh, right… rail. 🤦&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 To your original question, though, wasn’t kerosene one of the earliest commercially refined hydrocarbons?&#10;&#10;Apparently it’s so insignificant that it gets lumped in with “other oils” and isn’t otherwise mentioned in this report:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/tCueSa01Rk&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As often is the case, the futures markets know what’s coming before us mere mortals (back to using Diesel fuel as an example):&#10;&#10;Most airlines pre-purchase or otherwise hedge their fuel, as likely do militaries. Spot price purchases at the local FBO are at ones own peril. https://t.co/1wg1BAu9oC&#10;&#10;</description>
