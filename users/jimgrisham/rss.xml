			<description>@kamilkazani Other possibilities?&#10;- Z is a ‚Äòsharp‚Äô, ‚Äòwarlike‚Äô shape with no soft edges like in ‚Äò–∑‚Äô. Likewise with ‚ÄòV‚Äô/‚Äò–í‚Äô.&#10;History: ‚ÄúOnly the form ÍôÅ was used in the oldest ustav writing.‚Äù&#10;‚ÄúThe shape of the letter originally looked similar to a Greek Zeta with a tail on the bottom (ÍôÅ).‚Äù&#10;&#10;@kamilkazani ‚Ä¶ and if one is trying to ‚Äòrestore the glory (and lands)‚Äô of a former empire, using antique/anachronistic forms of symbols or letters may seem logical to them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@UAWeapons In addition, by not sending those expensive electronic modules, the ‚Äòbook cost‚Äô of the transfer was likely reduced, which allowed the USG to instead send additional munitions and supplies within the current approved budget authority.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bear_Faced @ClavdiaMinor @sentdefender The compartment where the fire victims were found was not nearly completely flooded, right?&#10;As memory serves, there were three(?) major fatal events (the initial explosion, secondary explosions several minutes later (that killed most crew), and only hours later the fire).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@moscow_english @sentdefender Fair. üòâ&#10;Besides, I‚Äôm sure their warships are as well maintained as their tanks.&#10;(I was always _amazed_, given the large volumes of seawater involved, whenever there was news of a submarine-submarine collision.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@moscow_english @sentdefender It‚Äôs not _that_ small of an area.&#10;They‚Äôd all fit in a large-sized harbor.&#10;The Black Sea is has a _surface area_ of 168,500 mi¬≤, equal area to a square 410 miles on each side.&#10;(i.e. 436,400 km¬≤, equal area to a square 660 km on each side)&#10;Also, submarines operate in 3D space.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bear_Faced @ClavdiaMinor @sentdefender Yes, but if poor maintenance practices had not lead to that fire (oily bilge water causing self-ignition of chemical oxygen generator cartridges, if I recall correctly), those crew members could have survived until rescued.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 I‚Äôm sure it can be flown in to airports without pipelines, but no idea what that adds to the cost.&#10;Does anyone know how western USA airports (especially in land-locked ones) get their fuel deliveries?&#10;Thinking of places such as MSP, SLC, DEN, BOI‚Ä¶&#10;‚Ä¶ oh, right‚Ä¶ rail. ü§¶&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 To your original question, though, wasn‚Äôt kerosene one of the earliest commercially refined hydrocarbons?&#10;&#10;Apparently it‚Äôs so insignificant that it gets lumped in with ‚Äúother oils‚Äù and isn‚Äôt otherwise mentioned in this report:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/tCueSa01Rk&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As often is the case, the futures markets know what‚Äôs coming before us mere mortals (back to using Diesel fuel as an example):&#10;&#10;Most airlines pre-purchase or otherwise hedge their fuel, as likely do militaries. Spot price purchases at the local FBO are at ones own peril. https://t.co/1wg1BAu9oC&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AbeFromanSox @ExtremelyTrains @RickPalaciosJr Homebuilding remains incredibly labor-intensive and resistant to automation.&#10;Apparently there are some in areas with short building seasons (e.g. Minnesota, USA) that factory-build wall panels (complete with insulation, piping, drywall, etc) to be crane-assembled on-site.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 It‚Äôs a complex system.&#10;The individual players operate on incomplete information.&#10;(example: refinery A sees excess capacity elsewhere in the market and decides not to expand, not knowing that some of that capacity is scheduled to go offline in 3-10 years)&#10;1/&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As long as prices are low / ‚Äòtimes are good‚Äô right now, it‚Äôs hard for voters prioritize an issue.&#10;&#10;When voters don‚Äôt care to prioritize an issue, it‚Äôs hard for politicians to care.&#10;&#10;2/3&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 Individual companies / governments try to manage their risks as much as possible, but that only goes so far.&#10;&#10;See also: progress on stopping global warming.&#10;&#10;3/3&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As far as ‚Äòadaptation‚Äô of individual trucks, though, not really.&#10;&#10;The current shortages should resolve due to normal market forces within 12‚Äì48 months.&#10;&#10;Long term, electrification and/or switching to hydrogen fuel will happen. (That‚Äôs 1‚Äì4 decades away, though.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradorado1 @whitemice @ExtremelyTrains @RickPalaciosJr Smaller ranch style homes often necessitate more yard space to compensate for reduced indoor space (think: kids playroom vs yard swingset).&#10;More yard space means fewer lots / acre for the developer, which also lowers profits.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 The refinery issues are apparently diesel-specific (especially re: low-sulfur diesel) and have been building for several years (i.e. pre-pandemic), but to the extent that any kerosene-based fuels are transported by diesel-powered trucks or trains, yes.&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As of 11 years ago, there was knowledge of potential #diesel supply issues.&#10;&#10;Today‚Äôs #DieselCrisis has been brewing for quite some time.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/dYYTB3Dxaq https://t.co/qTTt44QI81&#10;&#10;</description>
