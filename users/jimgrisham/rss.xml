			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux That there are only ‘two sides’ to any issue is a very dangerous mindset.&#10;(that’s not an indictment of your comment, just a general statement)&#10;Nature is probably the best example of ‘diversity’ in action (in terms of ‘evidence’), though.&#10;Consider the Irish potato famine.&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Since diversity in any complex system cannot ever be completely and sustainably eliminated, the most logical course is to embrace (or at least accept) that eventually.&#10;&#10;Any challenges can then be addressed head-on and based on their merits (rather than trying to assign blame).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien The ‘cultural narratives’ of the 90s and 2000s weren’t healthy, either.&#10;The majority of the politically powerful grew up in time where resources were abundant, education was nearly free, and yet were unhappy.&#10;It’s not that I’m saying they were spoiled, over-entitled, children… https://t.co/SdPk3fYzTv&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JohnHBillings @EliNew18 @Viking95 @BretDevereaux The Roman Empire could also be a vastly different society from one century to the next.&#10;Perhaps time/fate caught up with them, or perhaps by the end they lost sight of some of the qualities that made them once so adaptable.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EliNew18 @Viking95 @BretDevereaux Give us a generation and check back, please.&#10;The elders who remembered the hardships of hunger and war are gone.&#10;Much of the current ‘ruling class’ matured during a time of great abundance and are now somewhat set in their ways of thinking.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux If a place such as Lebanon magically became homogeneous, would all of its problems disappear?&#10;(I don’t actually know, of course)&#10;Diversity is often used as a target of blame when things are not going well with a society.&#10;Blame neighboring nations for ones intractable problems?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@IainBancarz @BurtWestermeier @BretDevereaux … and at the same time too large.&#10;If Malta instead had decided to leave the EU, they likely could have obtained better trade arrangements than the UK, because their economy is so much smaller; less of an economic threat/competitor.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@BurtWestermeier @BretDevereaux Very small, very large, or very remote seem to be the ‘sweet spots’ for stability.&#10;Switzerland, for example, is quite insular (… and holds defensible ground).&#10;A small city-state (such as Singapore, Monaco, etc) is less of a threat to others, and less of a prize to conquerors.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@QuercusCirratus @BretDevereaux That was a shameful and un-repented sin, yes.&#10;It was likely enabled by a lack of diversity among the powerful at the time.&#10;The pendulum between diversity and homogeneity swings over time; looking back it becomes clear which brings the most long-term piece and prosperity.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LaGazzettaEuro @AsaZernik @BretDevereaux The general population in the United States is also poorer than it was in the 1970s.&#10;…blaming immigration or globalization (for the United States) is a distraction; a magician’s slight-of-hand.&#10;There has been a general (worldwide) increase in income equality in recent decades.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LaGazzettaEuro @AsaZernik @BretDevereaux One would imagine suicide bombers tend to choose that path because the perceived benefits exceed the costs.&#10;Why do they feel they have nothing left to loose?&#10;That question would be uncomfortable for any society.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Previous major societal collapses happened in a different world, though.&#10;Today, even peasants can receive near instantaneous news from the other side of the planet.&#10;Young people in isolated and poor places (i.e. Nepal) have more options than ever.&#10;Uncharted territory this is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If Russia successfully breaks into pieces, the Basques might be inspired.&#10;Perhaps the Scots.&#10;Perhaps the Kurds.&#10;Andalusians. Balochs. Hmong. Palestinians. Rohingya. Uyghurs. Zulu.&#10;There will be an _enormous_ amount of elite pressure (worldwide) to prevent that idea spreading.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock The collapse of the USSR was rather orderly compared to what _could_ happen to the Russian Federation, though.&#10;If the Russian economy collapses before the government does, perhaps the chaos following the fall of Rome might be a better precedent?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Choosing unity under fire is a testament to the wisdom of your countrymen.&#10;[All humans are cousins to one another, of course; in future centuries, I sincerely hope the concept of ‘they’ (‘war’, too) becomes an anachronism.]&#10;The world is with your people.&#10;Слава Україні!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@britinvan @chumak_iryna @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock … but perhaps in different combinations today, due to changed demographics (some forced) and better communication.&#10;Unanswered question for future historians: were smaller nations preferable to larger ones?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Putin has managed to keep Russia together so far; whoever comes next may not be able to manage such an ‘empire’.&#10;Will that ‘siloviki’ survive, and will they still get paid? If so, will someone pay their salary from their own pockets? Will the ‘siloviki’ splinter or stay united?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock I agree.&#10;Outside of large cities, though, what if they didn’t _have_ to fight? If there is no one to fight against?&#10;If your town is a minority in a political subdivision, and the government collapses, then your town is a majority in your town.&#10;Perhaps your town becomes Monaco?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Parts of the USA would probably be better off as part of Canada, others as part of Mexico.&#10;Nation-states are such a recent contrivance, in terms of the history of human civilization. Their existence (and longevity) a thousand years from now may just be an interesting footnote.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock No, you’re exactly right. Ukraine has a better identity _because_ they were invaded.&#10;It’s still a social construct, but it’s a strong one.&#10;(In an alternate universe without Russia, Ukraine may have ultimately chosen to exist as several friendly neighbors instead of one whole.)&#10;&#10;@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Why is the United States one nation while Europe is many?&#10;&#10;It could have been 2, 7, 13, or 50, perhaps with a EU-like trade union.&#10;&#10;One might argue it’s just a good origin story (fighting against a common enemy) and a quirk of history / geography.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If it fractures into a hundred pieces,  nothing stops some of those pieces from later combining in different ways.&#10;One can’t have a gold watch without first having a supernova.&#10;I imagine other governments would fight that precedent; power fears “political self-determination”.&#10;&#10;</description>
