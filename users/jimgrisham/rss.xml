			<description>@amarelovex @Gotgoodies_ @izumabakumatsu @Peckham_Heights @OneMileataTime When the minimum wage laws were originally passed, several major categories of jobs (that were mostly held by women and minorities with no political power) were excluded, e.g.:&#10;- restaurant servers,&#10;- agricultural field workers, and&#10;- disabled workers in special ‘workshops’.</description>

			<description>@twinni_two @cmmhartmann On a zoom call of only sighted folks, I could imagine this being useful to associate voices with tiny thumbnail videos, so that when ‘Jena with the black cat on her desk’ speaks, you can look at her appropriate square?&#10;&#10;Perhaps more important with the shift to hybrid meetings?</description>

			<description>@pinkrocktopus @SaraAnnedipity @LouisatheLast @cmmhartmann Maybe if there were three ‘Jaras’ in the room and the so you could mentally associate one as “Greenshirt Jara” and another as “Redshirt Jara”?</description>

			<description>@alicetragedy @cmmhartmann In a well-crafted presentation, aren’t most images actually ‘visual aids’, designed to help compensate for the average sighted person having poor listening / reading comprehension skills?</description>

			<description>@magpie @cmmhartmann @SyHoekstra That seems reasonable…&#10;&#10;… I still can’t believe race or physical characteristics are ever even discussed!?!?&#10;&#10;(except in rare cases, e.g. “Chad here is our business specialist on the Iranian market - they lived there until the age of 23” or “Marta can crawl through air ducts”)</description>

			<description>@jeverehowell @DrDanSchumacher @DrRissman Those with certain government security clearances are REQUIRED to undergo the procedure WITHOUT any type of sedation.&#10;&#10;Knowing this, an experienced provider can often manage any discomfort with ease, adding no more than a few minutes to the entire procedure.</description>

			<description>@GMooBah @BadRaving @KS4P45 @floellaella Even the ‘expensive’ options tend to have only a 7-10 year payback period.&#10;&#10;If you own a home and plan on living there for a decade+, it’s worth taking the time to add up your current gas/oil/electric usage and compare costs over a longer term. Especially with low interest rates.</description>

			<description>@GMooBah @BadRaving @KS4P45 @floellaella The modern inverter-based ones (and some solar-compatible models) can work with _much_ lower ambient outdoor temperatures (well below freezing) than the old tech.&#10;&#10;Check out Stiebel Eltron - I believe they have some of these.&#10;&#10;(Ground-source heat pumps are ideal, but expensive.)</description>

			<description>@sneakin @SusanPotter Apparently, as it is often a family business, it can take decades for new technology / procedures to percolate through dentistry.&#10;&#10;[If the right funding / effort materializes, though, humanity may soon have a vaccine (or better) against the contagion responsible for tooth decay.]</description>
