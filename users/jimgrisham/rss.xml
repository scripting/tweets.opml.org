			<description>@glogeex @Aviation_Intel Satellites are too far away to _reliably_ communicate with legacy ballistic missile submarines at (or below) periscope depth.&#10;The closer the transmitter, the easier it is to communicate through jamming or interference (e.g. interference caused by post-nuclear blast ionization).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@HansMus40081520 @oryxspioenkop I didn’t expect submarine warfare to play such a big role in this invasion!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@igorsushko I wasn’t meaning to argue; just sharing an alternative viewpoint.&#10;Thank you for all you have done with your translations and videos and the work you continue to do!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DaveD1973 @MarkHertling That word seems to be reserved for mostly longer-range missiles?&#10;Honestly, the whole ‘hypersonic’ thing seems like a lot of hype. Objects that fast can easily be audibly triangulated; stand-off radar picket lines can communicate with distant defense systems at nearly lightspeed.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LipkaPasha @TrentTelenko Size and shape appear to be distorted on the left and right edges of that photograph due to the lens used, so that ‘dune buggy’ probably is much narrower IRL.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@igorsushko Part of the point of the US releasing that intelligence was also to inform as many people as possible.&#10;Advance notice of likely tactics allowed countermeasures to be put into place (e.g. disconnecting electrical transmission SCADA systems from networks, to prevent cyber attacks)&#10;&#10;@igorsushko i.e. the intelligence releases were acting as a sort of “ghost of Christmas future”; describing one possible future that could occur.&#10;&#10;Recall that at least publicly, Ukraine was saying (until almost immediately before) that the Russians wouldn’t actually invade at all.&#10;&#10;@igorsushko Because that intelligence was shared, it likely changed the tactics and preparations (of at least _some_ people and organizations).&#10;&#10;In sci-fi terms, they “interfered with the timeline”.&#10;&#10;That means, unlike a secret analysis, it’s likely impossible to gauge predictions’ accuracy.&#10;&#10;@igorsushko https://t.co/MBoAlLqzXN&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Ed_Fryer @PhillipsPOBrien They’ll probably start converting some roads to multi-gauge (i.e. 3 rails) as needed. Then, the existing equipment can be continued to be used.&#10;That’s what parts of Great Britain did when they changed gauges early on.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@drb0n3z @mattblaze It could have been data from his memory that he typed manually into an email.&#10;This sounds more like extreme carelessness than espionage.&#10;(The press release didn’t contain many details; the indictment may contain more information for the curious.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Javier_F @BrianWhedon @Euan_MacDonald It sounds like the implication is that different sized ships are sometimes commanded by different ranks.&#10;US Navy example:&#10;- Enlisted NCO commands motor launch&#10;- LT commanded WWII PT boat&#10;- CDR commands fast-attack submarine&#10;- CAPT commands cruiser&#10;(generally)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@macaroniii233 @igorsushko … or maybe a bunch of separate injunctions spread across multiple countries.&#10;In the mean time, the assets could continue to be laundered to new owners.&#10;@igorsushko’s point is that someone needs to be watching this. Probably many someones.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TheRobinCommon1 @BeauTFC Uncertainty can increase the psychological pressure on an enemy as well.&#10;Was it sabotage?&#10;Was it NATO frogmen?&#10;Was it divine retribution?&#10;Was it rouge Russian pilots?&#10;Did we deserve it somehow?&#10;If these types of questions distract even one Russian soldier, that’s a win.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Mr_A_McSquiffy @PhillipsPOBrien @KpsZSU Exactly!&#10;Too often we get stuck in an either/or kind of debate.&#10;If _our_ country was being attacked, and friendly aliens offered us the use of their fleet of armed ships, would we just shrug and say “nah, that looks too hard to learn - we’ll stick with our F-22s and trenches”?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Mr_A_McSquiffy @PhillipsPOBrien @KpsZSU Ukraine already has highly-trained air force pilots.&#10;They just need a few spare airframes (the higher-tech, the better, of course).&#10;This isn’t an ‘Independence Day’ sort of thing with flying farmers.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@WheaterRhys @PhillipsPOBrien @KpsZSU Most western pilots aren’t actively fighting a hot war during training; watching their nation burn.&#10;(Perhaps not a match for NATO AF/Naval aviators after two weeks, but they only have to be good enough to stay in the sky and deter the Russians.)&#10;Necessity is a wonderful teacher&#10;&#10;</description>
