			<description>@DethVeggie @ChrisO_wiki That would not be at all surprising.&#10;Desert storage is practically free… just look at all the old aircraft (both civil and military) put out to pasture there.&#10;(The primary reason we bother scrapping ships is due to limited harbor space and risk of environmental harm.)&#10;&#10;@DethVeggie @ChrisO_wiki Near the end of this video, the narrator implies that the photo _is_ old and those tanks are no longer in storage:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/eRoNBy8adV&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@cayley_s @spiantado There’s a desire to measure something, but in a large, complicated society, doing so is impracticable (even if theoretically solvable)?&#10;Perhaps there is nothing to measure universally? (Even the physical sciences contend with that.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@schneierblog Again, though, not so much a ‘flaw’ with Bluetooth itself; it’s more of an indictment of the hubris of the auto &amp;amp; lock manufacturers.&#10;“Gouda flaw leads to failure of organic-based bank vault locks during periods of high ambient temperatures.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@heathmcgough @TheRealJimSanto @AndrewDesiderio Unanimous among those present, that is.&#10;[I don’t believe the presence of individual Senators is recorded in these cases, so other than the Senator on camera calling the vote (and maybe a few others) it’s hard to pin down who voted and who was absent.]&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TheRealJimSanto @AndrewDesiderio It happens all the time, for both procedural motions and also for final confirmations. (Additionally, sometimes Senators just get too tired to argue and want to go home/fundraise.)&#10;Another benefit: with voice votes no one has to be on the record.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@smileyherring @MarkHertling Someone elsewhere stated it was some sort of NATO communications system? that wasn’t compatible with Ukrainian systems.&#10;They surely got whatever they needed (perhaps with the Canadian M777s) to utilize those advanced shells.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@kwestin Traditional RF proximity unlocking systems, as used in many “push-to-start” auto systems are vulnerable to the same class of attacks.&#10;If you don’t have to press a button in the remote, it’s vulnerable.&#10;Same thing with RFID (e.g. HID branded building access cards) systems, btw.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ophardy @igorsushko The bombers normally never leave Russian airspace.&#10;Some of the incoming missiles are being launched from from ships in the Caspian Sea, many hundreds of kilometers behind the border.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@FriedrichFiles @ThomasCatt1812 @amandalhu It can save tons on energy costs, though.&#10;For example, if you currently heat or cool your restaurant, any existing ventilation (e.g. bathrooms, kitchen, hvac) is dumping money into the outdoors. Much of this can be recovered.&#10;Economies of scale will eventually make commonplace.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Indeed: “a time” could easily be several _centuries_ or more (see: slaves of African descent), but no coercion can last forever.&#10;[I often wonder what the root causes of Chinese fear (other than centuries of pre-modern regional instability) is regarding those groups.]&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Indeed.&#10;Governments only exist with the consent of the governed, and societies only exist as long as their members stay together.&#10;Coercive force (physical, psychologic, economic, etc.) has sometimes worked to hold groups together, but only for a time.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux (That was not my intention but I understand that is how my comments may have been seen.)&#10;My opinion is irrelevant yet I have appreciated hearing yours.&#10;(Determining if there is a ‘right’ answer to that question seems quite academic as long as others have opposing views.)&#10;1/2&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux One must first agree with the premise of a question.&#10;&#10;As you said earlier, nearly anything can be turned into an advantage long-term.&#10;&#10;Since all diversity cannot be eliminated long-term, it seems prudent for societies to identify and mitigate the root causes of its problems.&#10;&#10;2/2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Perhaps!&#10;Political borders are complex social constructs and sometimes deserve to be changed.&#10;The ‘state’ is also a construct. An outcome can be simultaneously detrimental to a ‘state’ and advantageous to the (former) citizens of that ‘state’. The inverse may be more common.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@FriedrichFiles @ThomasCatt1812 @amandalhu Units called ‘Heat Recovery Ventilators’ and ‘Energy Recovery Ventilators’ are available that allow ventilation with negligible increases in energy usage by transferring heat (#HRV) or heat+humidity (#ERV) between the stale and fresh air.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Something can be a short-term weakness while being a long-term strength.&#10;If I am overwhelmed at work, I can hire an apprentice. I may be at a short-term disadvantage by having to devote time to training, but in the long-term this type of investment clearly is a winner.&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Political borders cannot survive forever unchanged.&#10;&#10;If the ‘internal division’ from your hypothetical is problematic &amp;amp; persists for decades, perhaps the borders need to be updated.&#10;&#10;Groups can disband, groups can coalesce. Groups can migrate.&#10;&#10;Nature shows this on many scales.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Politically it’s a mess. That’s not organic, though.&#10;Having travelled _many_ places here, I’ve found people in each town are overwhelmingly just concerned with surviving.&#10;The economic inequality and ‘shocks’ (or fear thereof) cause the political strife, not the inverse.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Whether it is a strength, a weakness, or neither/both seems to be a distraction (and perhaps unanswerable in a general sense for now).&#10;As with anything, one can aim to embrace beneficial factors and mitigate non-beneficial ones.&#10;In which circumstances was diversity a weakness?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien The facts on the ground are often quite different from the political and media discourse.&#10;(if racial discontent was ubiquitous it wouldn’t, by definition, be ‘news’)&#10;People have far more in common than not, and most will admit that in private conversation.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Race, after all, is a social construct.&#10;&#10;Racism generally appears in places where people do not feel secure, either physically, socially, or economically.&#10;&#10;A century ago, Italians were seen as the ‘other’ in the US. Any differences can be scary, especially when times are tough.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien If the poor people of &amp;lt;insert group here&amp;gt; are scary, but a wealthy and well educated member of that same group is not…&#10;&#10;… then the root fear is likely not of some grouping of people based on arbitrary characteristics, but rather due to the underlying assumptions being assigned.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Anti-migrant sentiments occur when political power or financial power is threatened.&#10;&#10;To a hypothetical nation of 100 million people, an influx of 1 million migrants (1%) is not a fear of (e.g.) ‘brown people’ but of ‘poor people’.&#10;&#10;Would they reject 20 million rich migrants?&#10;&#10;</description>
