			<description>@lrozen @lysa_modica It could actually be a bargaining chip to hasten a deal, to lower Russia’s resistance to restoring the #JCPOA …&#10;… or a way for Iran to bilk money out of Russia, knowing the UAVs won’t arrive in enough time or quantity to change the outcome of the invasion.&#10;Perhaps all three?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SolitudinarianA @Misty_Melanie It’s hard not to ‘miss intent’ when that intent conflicts with logic (e.g. consistency with past statements), and the plain meaning of language.&#10;Communication is a two-way street, and any failed communication (even if one party is ‘neuro-atypical’) indicates both sides can grow.&#10;&#10;@SolitudinarianA @Misty_Melanie Tl;dr: it’s not (all) you; it’s them too!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Dennis_Ramen @FemiYahtzee It is:&#10;1. hard (logistically speaking, to do at scale - i.e. each district needs to decide to take action, then decide what action to take, then hire/manage contractors)&#10;2. unlike post-9/11 security, not backed by lobbyists and high-margin consultants&#10;See also: infrastructure&#10;&#10;@Dennis_Ramen @FemiYahtzee To be clear, that wasn’t meant to excuse anyone… rather:&#10;&#10;The first step in conquering many problems, much like when defeating witches, is naming them.&#10;&#10;@Dennis_Ramen @FemiYahtzee #NotAllWitches&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@6502_ftw @albert_hubble @PhillipsPOBrien Exactly!&#10;Intelligence / targeting &amp;amp; force protection also limits rate of fire.&#10;[FWIW, and at the risk of sounding pedantic, the article based those numbers on the capacity of a C5 (Super ?) Galaxy, not the more nimble but ~much~ smaller C-130 Hercules.]&#10;https://t.co/V0DTpTSi3j&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@NDMcFly1 @TrentTelenko Someone else referred to the Russian ‘Tor’ systems… but went on to say that stocks of those were likely as depleted as anything else.&#10;Defeating _one_ incoming rocket is fine, but can you defeat ~all~ of the subsequent _99_?&#10;Only one has to actually hit the target.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@6502_ftw @hallam @PhillipsPOBrien @markos “A C-5 cargo plane can carry 140 tons of cargo, or 56 rocket pods—just 10-12 hours of fire missions for a single launcher.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@MIL_STD @andexihaeienni Nothing saying one with limited military vehicles couldn’t use both: commercial trucks for some areas and military ones for others.&#10;Also a combination, in a ‘relay’ fashion (i.e. commercial for medium/long distance, then transfer to military for ‘last-mile’ off-road delivery).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AansPaa @PinheiroFilJoa @OScottson @IAPonomarenko Explosives-laden rail boxcar.&#10;Trigger using any combination of barometric pressure / time / accelerometer triggers (since the altitude profile of the route can be easily calculated from publicly available data).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lucashealthlaw It might be legally tricky as long as the Congress continues to renew the #HydeAmendment… likely why military hospitals aren’t a practical option at the moment.&#10;(Leasing out space at market rates might be possible, though.)&#10;https://t.co/Qb3hUPiQn2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ReflectiveKen @AuthorConfusion @jonsteingard I thought the (fictional) description was more akin to a blender or a parallel-to-serial encoder;&#10;i.e. the matter isn’t converted to energy, but rather sent in a very tight stream (as subatomic or perhaps quantum particles?) and then reassembled (much as a 3d printer does).&#10;&#10;@ReflectiveKen @AuthorConfusion @jonsteingard (tight enough to pass through the mostly empty space in otherwise ‘solid’ walls, etc.)&#10;&#10;If it was purely an energy-based copy, you could always reassemble the new version (and verify accuracy) before destroying the old - killing nearly all plots involving transporter ‘accidents’!&#10;&#10;@ReflectiveKen @AuthorConfusion @jonsteingard FWIW:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/m0DKsZQzXd&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics {it seems the graduate student and his honest-to-a-fault fiancée, after actually saying it out loud, realized what they were suggesting and _did not_ actually steal any wood}&#10;But yes, sadly, those #TragedyOfTheCommons results are …common; see: #ClimateChange &amp;amp; #CampaignFinance.&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics It’s horribly troubling for society.&#10;&#10;The vast majority of people, in any large group, are honest and well-meaning, or believe they are.&#10;&#10;⚠️ The highly-evolved instincts that served our distant hunter-gather ancestors well haven’t had very long to adapt to life in huge societies.&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics Apologies for carrying on like that.&#10;#SharingIsCaring? 🤷&#10;&#10;~~&#10;&#10;For anyone persistent enough to see this, a reward to blow your mind for the weekend:&#10;&#10;Part 1 by @cgpgrey (4 min, 57 sec): https://t.co/3CrgqQXodr&#10;&#10;Part 2 by @Kurz_Gesagt (6 min, 27 sec): https://t.co/WjXYYh38Y2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lift_Our_Voice Exactly.&#10;Make new friends.&#10;Ask if they are registered to vote; if not, offer to help them to find out how to register or request mail/#absentee ballots.&#10;Offer to walk with them to the polls, or help to arrange rides for those who need it.&#10;Election day should be a party!&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice Most humans desire #agency, but many of us either don’t know it is possible or have given up seeking it.&#10;&#10;Research has shown that even non-partisan messages such as “4 out of 5 of your neighbors voted in the last election” can be highly motivational!&#10;&#10;*Use only real stats, obvs!&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice #SocialProof&#10;&#10;“Japan in the Covid-19 pandemic, where they looked at the willingness … to wear a mask, and they looked at a variety of possible reasons: …&#10;&#10;The only one that made any difference was the number of people they saw wearing masks.”&#10;&#10;https://t.co/HT4K6OBr04&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice One more story from that @Freakonomics Radio podcast episode:&#10;&#10;“If a lot of people are doing it, it must be the right thing to do.&#10;&#10;I had a graduate student who was coming to work with me from California, and he and his fiancée — the woman he described as the single most …”&#10;&#10;1/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics “… honest person he had ever known in his life; she wouldn’t borrow a paper clip that she did not return — they decided,&#10;&#10;‘Well, let’s go see the Petrified Forest in northern Arizona on our way to work with Cialdini.’&#10;&#10;And they were standing in front of a sign …”&#10;&#10;2/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics “…at the entrance that said,&#10;&#10;‘So many people are stealing petrified wood and crystals that the forest is endangered.’&#10;&#10;Some kind of language like that. And my graduate student, while he was still reading the sign, felt this elbow in his ribs, and …”&#10;&#10;3/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics “…his invariably honest fiancée said,&#10;&#10;‘We better get ours, too.’&#10;&#10;(Stephen) DUBNER: ‘Before it’s all gone.’”&#10;&#10;~&#10;&#10;(That episode also has great stories about the #CubanMissileCrisis, online product reviews, #PsychologicalReactance, and _many_ other topics.)&#10;&#10;4/4&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics A final quote from social psychologist @RobertCialdini:&#10;&#10;“Thinking is hard work.&#10;&#10;Especially in an environment of such challenge and change and overload.&#10;&#10;So, it is simpler and easier to use our shortcuts.&#10;&#10;…”&#10;&#10;1/2&#10;&#10;@Lift_Our_Voice @Freakonomics @RobertCialdini “…&#10;&#10;Most of the time, if they’re well-founded, they steer us correctly.&#10;&#10;But some percentage of the time, they steer us very poorly.”&#10;&#10;2/2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lift_Our_Voice For _each_ citizen that moves to a new state/area: perhaps they can befriend and convince, on average, _at least_ one new non-voting neighbor to actually vote within the first few months.&#10;(The DoD would call this a #ForceMultiplier tactic.)&#10;&#10;</description>
