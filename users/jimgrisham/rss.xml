			<description>@moscow_english @sentdefender It‚Äôs not _that_ small of an area.&#10;They‚Äôd all fit in a large-sized harbor.&#10;The Black Sea is has a _surface area_ of 168,500 mi¬≤, equal area to a square 410 miles on each side.&#10;(i.e. 436,400 km¬≤, equal area to a square 660 km on each side)&#10;Also, submarines operate in 3D space.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bear_Faced @ClavdiaMinor @sentdefender Yes, but if poor maintenance practices had not lead to that fire (oily bilge water causing self-ignition of chemical oxygen generator cartridges, if I recall correctly), those crew members could have survived until rescued.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bill_Abely @brandonazheng @Noahpinion ‚ÄúThey‚Äù has long been a default when it is not known what pronoun to use; e.g.:&#10;A: ‚ÄúSomeone broke into my car last night.‚Äù&#10;B: ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs horrible! Did they steal anything valuable?‚Äù&#10;A: ‚ÄúNo, that almost makes it worse. They broke two windows for nothing!‚Äù&#10;B: ‚ÄúI hope they get caught!‚Äù&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 I‚Äôm sure it can be flown in to airports without pipelines, but no idea what that adds to the cost.&#10;Does anyone know how western USA airports (especially in land-locked ones) get their fuel deliveries?&#10;Thinking of places such as MSP, SLC, DEN, BOI‚Ä¶&#10;‚Ä¶ oh, right‚Ä¶ rail. ü§¶&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 To your original question, though, wasn‚Äôt kerosene one of the earliest commercially refined hydrocarbons?&#10;&#10;Apparently it‚Äôs so insignificant that it gets lumped in with ‚Äúother oils‚Äù and isn‚Äôt otherwise mentioned in this report:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/tCueSa01Rk&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As often is the case, the futures markets know what‚Äôs coming before us mere mortals (back to using Diesel fuel as an example):&#10;&#10;Most airlines pre-purchase or otherwise hedge their fuel, as likely do militaries. Spot price purchases at the local FBO are at ones own peril. https://t.co/1wg1BAu9oC&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AbeFromanSox @ExtremelyTrains @RickPalaciosJr Homebuilding remains incredibly labor-intensive and resistant to automation.&#10;Apparently there are some in areas with short building seasons (e.g. Minnesota, USA) that factory-build wall panels (complete with insulation, piping, drywall, etc) to be crane-assembled on-site.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 It‚Äôs a complex system.&#10;The individual players operate on incomplete information.&#10;(example: refinery A sees excess capacity elsewhere in the market and decides not to expand, not knowing that some of that capacity is scheduled to go offline in 3-10 years)&#10;1/&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As long as prices are low / ‚Äòtimes are good‚Äô right now, it‚Äôs hard for voters prioritize an issue.&#10;&#10;When voters don‚Äôt care to prioritize an issue, it‚Äôs hard for politicians to care.&#10;&#10;2/3&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 Individual companies / governments try to manage their risks as much as possible, but that only goes so far.&#10;&#10;See also: progress on stopping global warming.&#10;&#10;3/3&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As far as ‚Äòadaptation‚Äô of individual trucks, though, not really.&#10;&#10;The current shortages should resolve due to normal market forces within 12‚Äì48 months.&#10;&#10;Long term, electrification and/or switching to hydrogen fuel will happen. (That‚Äôs 1‚Äì4 decades away, though.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradorado1 @whitemice @ExtremelyTrains @RickPalaciosJr Smaller ranch style homes often necessitate more yard space to compensate for reduced indoor space (think: kids playroom vs yard swingset).&#10;More yard space means fewer lots / acre for the developer, which also lowers profits.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 Refineries have been closed all over the world over the past several years, due to various incentives.&#10;Political discourse was likely distracted by the pandemic? Tragedy of the commons?&#10;#NotAnExpert&#10;1/4&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 ‚ÄúIn the US, capacity has fallen by ~1mb/d since 2019, as (5 producers) jumped at government incentives to convert large oil refineries to very small bio-fuel refineries.‚Äù&#10;&#10;2/4&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 ‚ÄúIn Europe, Exxon shut the Slagen refinery in Norway, Gunvor shut two units in Rotterdam and one refinery in Antwerp, Total converted Grandpruits, Neste shut Naantali and Galp shut its Poro refinery.‚Äù&#10;&#10;3/4&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 ‚ÄúAll in the past two years.&#10;&#10;According to the IEA, global refinery closers outpaced capacity additions in 2021 for the first time in 30 years.‚Äù&#10;&#10;from: https://t.co/UGAlE40nM4&#10;&#10;4/4&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 The refinery issues are apparently diesel-specific (especially re: low-sulfur diesel) and have been building for several years (i.e. pre-pandemic), but to the extent that any kerosene-based fuels are transported by diesel-powered trucks or trains, yes.&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As of 11 years ago, there was knowledge of potential #diesel supply issues.&#10;&#10;Today‚Äôs #DieselCrisis has been brewing for quite some time.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/dYYTB3Dxaq https://t.co/qTTt44QI81&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@slamastack The only safe tech for this sort of thing is legacy, open-standard tech such as #X10 or #Insteon and the modern (but much more complicated) #Zigbee or proprietary (#Zwave) equivalents.&#10;Worst-case, a hub might have to be replaced. My X-10 switches from the mid-90s still work!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DrKateJMiller @CanadianKayMD I‚Äôve heard that until a decade or so ago, the common belief was that it was something kids outgrew by adulthood, so diagnosis was rarely sought or offered.&#10;It‚Äôs probably _vastly_ undiagnosed in people currently over age 30, and even more so for people over age 50.&#10;&#10;</description>
