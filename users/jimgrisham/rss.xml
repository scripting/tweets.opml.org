			<description>@IainBancarz @BurtWestermeier @BretDevereaux … and at the same time too large.&#10;If Malta instead had decided to leave the EU, they likely could have obtained better trade arrangements than the UK, because their economy is so much smaller; less of an economic threat/competitor.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@BurtWestermeier @BretDevereaux Very small, very large, or very remote seem to be the ‘sweet spots’ for stability.&#10;Switzerland, for example, is quite insular (… and holds defensible ground).&#10;A small city-state (such as Singapore, Monaco, etc) is less of a threat to others, and less of a prize to conquerors.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@QuercusCirratus @BretDevereaux That was a shameful and un-repented sin, yes.&#10;It was likely enabled by a lack of diversity among the powerful at the time.&#10;The pendulum between diversity and homogeneity swings over time; looking back it becomes clear which brings the most long-term piece and prosperity.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LaGazzettaEuro @AsaZernik @BretDevereaux The general population in the United States is also poorer than it was in the 1970s.&#10;…blaming immigration or globalization (for the United States) is a distraction; a magician’s slight-of-hand.&#10;There has been a general (worldwide) increase in income equality in recent decades.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LaGazzettaEuro @AsaZernik @BretDevereaux One would imagine suicide bombers tend to choose that path because the perceived benefits exceed the costs.&#10;Why do they feel they have nothing left to loose?&#10;That question would be uncomfortable for any society.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Previous major societal collapses happened in a different world, though.&#10;Today, even peasants can receive near instantaneous news from the other side of the planet.&#10;Young people in isolated and poor places (i.e. Nepal) have more options than ever.&#10;Uncharted territory this is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If Russia successfully breaks into pieces, the Basques might be inspired.&#10;Perhaps the Scots.&#10;Perhaps the Kurds.&#10;Andalusians. Balochs. Hmong. Palestinians. Rohingya. Uyghurs. Zulu.&#10;There will be an _enormous_ amount of elite pressure (worldwide) to prevent that idea spreading.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock The collapse of the USSR was rather orderly compared to what _could_ happen to the Russian Federation, though.&#10;If the Russian economy collapses before the government does, perhaps the chaos following the fall of Rome might be a better precedent?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Choosing unity under fire is a testament to the wisdom of your countrymen.&#10;[All humans are cousins to one another, of course; in future centuries, I sincerely hope the concept of ‘they’ (‘war’, too) becomes an anachronism.]&#10;The world is with your people.&#10;Слава Україні!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@britinvan @chumak_iryna @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock … but perhaps in different combinations today, due to changed demographics (some forced) and better communication.&#10;Unanswered question for future historians: were smaller nations preferable to larger ones?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Putin has managed to keep Russia together so far; whoever comes next may not be able to manage such an ‘empire’.&#10;Will that ‘siloviki’ survive, and will they still get paid? If so, will someone pay their salary from their own pockets? Will the ‘siloviki’ splinter or stay united?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock I agree.&#10;Outside of large cities, though, what if they didn’t _have_ to fight? If there is no one to fight against?&#10;If your town is a minority in a political subdivision, and the government collapses, then your town is a majority in your town.&#10;Perhaps your town becomes Monaco?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Parts of the USA would probably be better off as part of Canada, others as part of Mexico.&#10;Nation-states are such a recent contrivance, in terms of the history of human civilization. Their existence (and longevity) a thousand years from now may just be an interesting footnote.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock No, you’re exactly right. Ukraine has a better identity _because_ they were invaded.&#10;It’s still a social construct, but it’s a strong one.&#10;(In an alternate universe without Russia, Ukraine may have ultimately chosen to exist as several friendly neighbors instead of one whole.)&#10;&#10;@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Why is the United States one nation while Europe is many?&#10;&#10;It could have been 2, 7, 13, or 50, perhaps with a EU-like trade union.&#10;&#10;One might argue it’s just a good origin story (fighting against a common enemy) and a quirk of history / geography.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If it fractures into a hundred pieces,  nothing stops some of those pieces from later combining in different ways.&#10;One can’t have a gold watch without first having a supernova.&#10;I imagine other governments would fight that precedent; power fears “political self-determination”.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock With no army, what (besides economic limitations) would prevent some of those displaced groups from returning to their ancestral lands?&#10;Perhaps the oligarchs, warlords, and other elites will all band together under a common banner, but it seems at least as likely they would not.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Yes, their ability to protest _within the system_ was intentionally and systematically removed.&#10;If the entire national political system collapses (not predicting that, at all, but it is a possibility), internal borders lose much of their significance.&#10;2 pieces, or 28, or 80?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock “National identity” is sort of like fiat currency… it only has value as long as enough of the citizens believe it does.&#10;In such a culturally heterogeneous (and expansive) nation as the Russian Federation, that identity can collapse just like an unstable currency.&#10;Quickly.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KiarKini @chumak_iryna @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock The Russian ‘Federation’ can fail, but the pieces could still prosper.&#10;(Agreed that a failed, but intact, Russia would be a disaster on many levels.)&#10;Self-determination is an essential human right.&#10;Central management from Moscow has failed _multiple_ times over the centuries.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Putin is not as strong as he once was.&#10;He allegedly has health issues.&#10;The republics don’t have to beat him any more, they just need to plan and wait.&#10;With the current economic issues (and the army decimated), the resulting power vacuum will cause regions to just drift away.&#10;&#10;@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock What holds this vast, culturally diverse, federation together?&#10;&#10;Is it just fear*, tradition, and inertia? Perhaps a little economics? Will that suffice for the next few months/years/decades?&#10;&#10;What will Russia look like in 2122?&#10;&#10;(* of Putin, the police, the army, or the unknown)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@sppeterson @francis_scarr The more complex a system, the more humans try to simplify it (for often very understandable reasons).&#10;This unfortunately tends to strip out redundancy and causes the system to become more brittle / less adaptive.&#10;Which types of present-day societies will still exist in 2122?&#10;&#10;</description>
