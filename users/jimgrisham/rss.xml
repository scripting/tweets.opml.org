			<description>@Douglas94342267 @ChrisO_wiki There are counter-drone systems in service now that effectively can protect the area around high-value persons or military units, but new solutions are needed for protecting soldiers dispersed over a larger area.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SOSuburbia They can be built almost completely out of lumber in most places now due to building code changes over the last decade‚Ä¶ but 7+ stories requires masonry, reinforced concrete, steel, or custom timber engineering design and approvals.&#10;Adding just one story more could kill profits.&#10;&#10;@SOSuburbia While #MassTimber has potential for very tall buildings in the future, for now it appears that 6 stories is what can easily and quickly get approved.&#10;&#10;2014: https://t.co/Hi5nc7dNzV&#10;&#10;2021: https://t.co/g9nzrRidg2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AberdeenAsher @NotWoofers Yes, we should absolutely do that as well!&#10;Also, I can‚Äôt imagine this will hurt:&#10;https://t.co/qkTT8OTNYv&#10;&#10;@AberdeenAsher @NotWoofers ‚ÄúAmong other provisions, the bill would allow the United States to provide equipment to Ukraine now, with just a technical requirement to pay at some later date, essentially giving it to the Kyiv government.‚Äù&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Djsmokybacon From everything I‚Äôve been hearing, I would not bet the farm on any sustained decreases this summer.&#10;Maybe(?) next summer?&#10;Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine has apparently savaged European biodiesel production potential for the year, which is going to make this mess even worse. üòû&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@youngsteveng @gordon_struth @urbanthoughts11 Wrigley Field, much like Fenway, were built before car culture had taken over the nation.&#10;&#10;@youngsteveng @gordon_struth @urbanthoughts11 ‚Ä¶ but not to disappoint, they do have a remote surface parking lot a bit to the northwest.&#10;&#10;AFAIK, that land (as well as the several smaller lots closer to the ballpark itself) get little to no use when Wrigley is idle.&#10;&#10;Wrigley does have decent bus and rail connections, though! https://t.co/6RZXUZlPdh&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Djsmokybacon Sadly, it‚Äôs unlikely to get better for a long while - it‚Äôs a world-wide problem.&#10;Two items of note from early February:&#10;- refining capacity is down, and&#10;- refiners are afraid of losing money on jet fuel by increasing crude processing rates.&#10;https://t.co/r0jDaaxK32&#10;&#10;@Djsmokybacon In addition to current high natural gas prices (apparently needed to help process low-sulfur diesel), post-pandemic demand, and regional issues:&#10;&#10;‚Äúthe global oil refining complex is under strain, with capacity falling for the first time in 30 years last year‚Äù&#10;&#10;‚Ä¶ and ‚Ä¶&#10;&#10;2/3&#10;&#10;@Djsmokybacon ‚Äúrefineries - particularly in the U.S. - are still running plants at rates below the five-year average to avoid producing too much jet fuel, ‚Ä¶, leaving companies struggling to identify a clear way to restock diesel inventories in the short term.‚Äù&#10;&#10;3/3&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AberdeenAsher @NotWoofers Aren‚Äôt most ‚Äòexport model‚Äô items only manufactured on demand (after any necessary re-tooling or design changes are made for the receiving military)?&#10;I believe the current focus is to generally provide equipment and weapons that are now actually in stock and combat-ready.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dave_luce @gordon_struth @urbanthoughts11 It‚Äôs not a urban stadium, but compare and contrast how even this parking-heavy example approaches land use and pedestrian / cycling connections compared to most of the American locations cited: https://t.co/eXdXlSC6sG&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dave_luce @gordon_struth @urbanthoughts11 They buried much of the parking for Soldier Field twenty years ago, but it‚Äôs certainly not what I‚Äôd call ‚Äòwalkable‚Äô (unless your yacht is berthed in the nearby marina, that is): https://t.co/frtFYIwxj2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dancaroselli These have been popping up in cities nationwide after building code changes in the last decade allowed quick approval of fully wood-frame construction for 4-6 story buildings. Density for cheap!&#10;(* the actual allowed number of stories depends on a number of factors, as I recall)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jmcevoy_2 That quote doesn‚Äôt seem to support a claim of potential ‚Äúkidnap or murder‚Äù.&#10;At one point ‚Äúgrabbing him‚Äù is mentioned, but freeing him from extrajudicial extradition is hardly kidnapping.&#10;The ‚Äúshooting‚Äù is in reference disabling aircraft tires, not people.&#10;What am I missing?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DaveDopson @JeffyIsFat @TrentTelenko It‚Äôs almost certainly a C-17 Globemaster III.&#10;Quite possible they‚Äôve loaded below capacity for expediency and range. At least 12 flights went out yesterday.&#10;Waiting until they are completely full adds loading and unloading time and can clog last-mile logistics.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Kurt_von_Bosse @TrentTelenko I recently interviewed an active USAF F-15 pilot (w/ about 12 years experience) about this.&#10;When I asked how long it would take, for example, for her to learn to fly a F-16, she:&#10;- laughed&#10;- said it would likely take _years_&#10;‚Ä¶&#10;1/&#10;&#10;@Kurt_von_Bosse @TrentTelenko Being designed by two different contractors, the flight controls and displays are _completely_ different.&#10;&#10;I pressed her and said, okay, but let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre at war, most of the F-16 pilots are dead‚Ä¶surely you can learn it faster if necessary, right?&#10;&#10;Not that much faster‚Ä¶&#10;&#10;2/&#10;&#10;@Kurt_von_Bosse @TrentTelenko She explained, for example, that there are finger controls on the control sticks designed to replicate all of the flight / radio / navigation / etc. controls so the pilot doesn‚Äôt have to move their hands during combat flight:&#10;&#10;3/4&#10;&#10;@Kurt_von_Bosse @TrentTelenko - these are _vastly_ different between the F-15 and F-16, and it can take years to build up the muscle memory to be able to operate them quickly, accurately, and automatically* ‚Ä¶&#10;&#10;‚Ä¶ while flying at very high speeds.&#10;&#10;(* i.e. as ‚Äòautomatic‚Äô as you or I wiggling a thumb)&#10;&#10;4/4&#10;&#10;@Kurt_von_Bosse @TrentTelenko Disclaimer: Ukraine should still get whatever jets they can, as soon as they can.&#10;&#10;If nothing else, it‚Äôs a good deterrence &amp;amp; #psyops measure.&#10;&#10;(If they somehow found a working F-15 in an unguarded barn near the Polish border, a recently retired F-15 pilot or two may emigrate.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DougCarlisle @TrentTelenko This is where mesh networks shine!&#10;In reality, though, if you can get a clear signal when the container is loaded/unloaded by a crane, couldn‚Äôt tracking automatically just switch to following the ship? Power-save when stationary (i.e. in a yard) or in the dark?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Behrooz60 @Aintropy @PhillipsPOBrien Sonic triangulation could be a simple and cheap possible method (i.e. cell phone microphones hidden in barns at known coordinates)&#10;Alternatively: ISR drones, satellite ISR, RF triangulation, GPS transmitter on a fuze in an otherwise ‚Äòdumb‚Äô shell, luck‚Ä¶ or just local partisans.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@CrankyThegn @Noahpinion And modern semi-automated artillery such as the CAESAR appear to be able to load and fire a round in as little as 9-10 sec.&#10;That‚Äôs 6 / min per gun; with 5 guns you could reach 30+ 155mm shells / minute!&#10;Targeting delays probably result in slower real-world rates of fire.&#10;&#10;</description>
