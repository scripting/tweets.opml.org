			<description>@horsemankukka Perhaps, but why go to 1000 if you could just send it directly with a simple `print #1 …` like line 360 does?&#10;(in fact, if not for that line, I would have assumed that 1000 added some common command prefix, such as the ‘6’ prefix for LD players that the SIRC protocol uses)&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka Their modern protocols, such as `P2` do this (command codes have evolved over the decades, of course, but their more modern _syntax_ might still enlighten understanding of earlier versions).&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka From several generations later, and a completely different kind of device:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/IbH5fMgSXR&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka … but, based on the DAPHNE emulator code @foone linked to earlier, assuming control codes there (same as in the BASIC above) are valid for their device, I’d still look first to a flow control misconfiguration.&#10;&#10;RS-232 flow control is a haunted minefield, as I recall.&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka @Foone From my experience with barcode scanners, I’ve learned that dedicated troubleshooting tools that can directly send/receive individual bytes (or arbitrary bit sequences… #SIRC uses _13_-bit commands!) really help.&#10;&#10;Not a recommendation, just an example:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/ABDJRsq0QQ&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka @Foone This is the most complete version I could find of the Sony command codes matching those in the BASIC code above (but I haven’t confirmed these are appropriate for the specific device in question):&#10;&#10;https://t.co/E6OkUA9emG&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka @Foone Dating from 1994, this document shows a completely different command structure (used over RS-422, but could still be instructive):&#10;&#10;https://t.co/KGrQRRGnIW&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka @Foone (that’s the “Sony 9-pin protocol”, or “P1”, and apparently dates at least as far back as 1982 #Betamax decks; it’s still used in industry today!)&#10;&#10;The laserdisc RS-232 protocol appears to have been designed for applications such as business presentations, kiosks, and video games.&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka @Foone Sony’s first Industrial/Commercial players with a RS-232C interface used that ‘Sony LDP series command protocol’, more fully documented here:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/IOQmPdmL3l&#10;&#10;(including a link to a scanned version of the _official protocol/command interface manual_)&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka @Foone As suspected, control of the RS-232 `DTR` line is important (and is what enables the “EXT CPU” indicator); as is the timing of commands &amp;amp;parameters.&#10;&#10;Also, page 113 notably describes minor differences in startup/ack code semantics between various models in the early ‘LDP’ series. https://t.co/b2UAS9betR&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Foone Futher digging into JVC and Sony control codes imply the commands might be much more than single-byte sequences:&#10;- text data / commands might end with CR, LF, CR+LF, a single or double `null` byte, or nothing&#10;- multi-byte command sequences may be sent in _big endian_ order&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@horsemankukka Just for fun:&#10;The line 1000 ‘function’ (using the value of global variable `X` instead of parameter) sends (or queues) an opcode / command.&#10;1/&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka The line 2000 ‘function’ likewise uses the value of global variable `Y`, sending it in a different format to indicate an operand / additional data to a previous command.&#10;&#10;The command at line 360 is sent directly, however, without the aid of either of those ‘functions’.&#10;&#10;2/&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka The lines after the first two commands sent via ‘function’ 1000 don’t appear to handle any ‘success codes’, so either that function contains conditional logic to automatically accept them for those cmds that don’t require operands (sort of multi-threading, AT BASIC-style?), …&#10;3/&#10;&#10;@horsemankukka … or perhaps the device only sends confirmations for those commands (such as seeking) that are expected to take a bit of time (in addition to any commands, of course, which are specifically designed to return an answer to a request).&#10;&#10;Curious indeed.&#10;&#10;4/4&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@horsemankukka Yup.&#10;After reading your reply, I noticed that the serial port was defined as ‘#1’ as used in the `input` statement.🤦&#10;[Without scoping it, there are just too many variables (e.g. USB adapters, cap. aging, RS-232F vs RS-232C, flow cont, clock drift) for more conjecture from me.]&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Foone It’s because the Laserdisc player was acting like a computer itself, a #DTE, and not as a #DCE / peripheral.&#10;Connecting any two DTEs (e.g. two PCs) generally required a null modem cable/adapter.&#10;There are reasons the world has mostly moved on from the likes of RS-232 and SCSI!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@horsemankukka @Foone Fair; my BASIC knowledge is 30+ years out of date.&#10;Without seeing the rest of the code, I considered that the success code may have just been from the local serial driver, and the inquired frame number displayed on the TV/video output via the text generator board (vs serial rx).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Foone I’m assuming you’ve tried sending every possible character, in sequence, from ox00 to 0xff…&#10;Last thought… USB RS-232C interfaces didn’t exist back then… perhaps the player is sinking more current than your (presumed) RS-232E USB adapter is designed or configured to supply?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Foone What voltage is your RS-232 driver putting out?&#10;Perhaps the player is more picky than the spec (especially considering capacitor aging)… but based on the light (and other reactions) you mentioned, it does seem the player is sensing a connection in some way.&#10;&#10;@Foone I don’t remember seeing a serial _out_ pin on the main control processor for the `MR1`, so I wouldn’t get too discouraged by not seeing any serial data _from_ the Sony:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/OoZAjbOz6p&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Foone Octal was used a bunch back then; a long shot, but those single character commands in the BASIC source might be specified in decimal, hex, or octal??&#10;i.e.:&#10;Clear LDP: 8 or V or .&#10;Index disp on: 2 or P or (&#10;Search: + or C or #&#10;Repeat: , or D or $&#10;Frame inq: &amp;lt; or ` or 0&#10;&#10;@Foone Also, it could be a one-way protocol… just like an infrared remote control.&#10;&#10;Most shuttle-jog and similar controllers from the era had no display at all; they would not expect nor listen to any feedback from the device (except for perhaps invisible RS-232 flow-control codes).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Foone Nope; only that it’s via RS-232C.&#10;It appears Sony and JVC may have shared the same protocol, so the authoritative reference _may_ be JVC and not Sony.&#10;(images for the MR1, not the 1700AR) https://t.co/IaJ3MAZRNg&#10;&#10;@Foone Several FutureVideo controllers supported that model via their FV0079 cable - perhaps that will lead somewhere promising.&#10;&#10;(Bonus: a small company like that wil l have a _much_ smaller patent search space than either JVC or Sony!)&#10;&#10;https://t.co/nhUUoUMcX4&#10;&#10;https://t.co/iGTvBAj9Nb&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ftp_alun @concreted0g @Hogan698 @bookwormwmb @TheRealHoarse @shaunwalker7 You could reload paintballs with actual paint (or other substances), right?&#10;A syringe with an ISO 18 G (or larger) needle should probably work, available from any pharmacy.
