			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Agreed.&#10;Normally force is needed to overcome force, yes, but what realistic force of the state will be left after the current misadventures? https://t.co/jZulDklg1Y&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock ‚ÄúNational identity‚Äù is sort of like fiat currency‚Ä¶ it only has value as long as enough of the citizens believe it does.&#10;In such a culturally heterogeneous (and expansive) nation as the Russian Federation, that identity can collapse just like an unstable currency.&#10;Quickly.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KiarKini @chumak_iryna @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock The Russian ‚ÄòFederation‚Äô can fail, but the pieces could still prosper.&#10;(Agreed that a failed, but intact, Russia would be a disaster on many levels.)&#10;Self-determination is an essential human right.&#10;Central management from Moscow has failed _multiple_ times over the centuries.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Putin is not as strong as he once was.&#10;He allegedly has health issues.&#10;The republics don‚Äôt have to beat him any more, they just need to plan and wait.&#10;With the current economic issues (and the army decimated), the resulting power vacuum will cause regions to just drift away.&#10;&#10;@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock What holds this vast, culturally diverse, federation together?&#10;&#10;Is it just fear*, tradition, and inertia? Perhaps a little economics? Will that suffice for the next few months/years/decades?&#10;&#10;What will Russia look like in 2122?&#10;&#10;(* of Putin, the police, the army, or the unknown)&#10;&#10;</description>

Russian conscripts in half-century-old tanks?&#10;‚Ä¶ followed by #Tatarstan and #Bashkortostan/#Bashkiria, followed by the other remaining republics of the federation.&#10;&#10;@britinvan @chumak_iryna @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Do the people of #Sakha/#Yakutiya enjoy being ruled from nearly 4900 km away, or would they rather keep their mineral wealth and chart their own path?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@sppeterson @francis_scarr The more complex a system, the more humans try to simplify it (for often very understandable reasons).&#10;This unfortunately tends to strip out redundancy and causes the system to become more brittle / less adaptive.&#10;Which types of present-day societies will still exist in 2122?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DublinReader @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Exactly!&#10;Complex systems, whether social, economic, biologic, or technologic (e.g. the Challenger disaster) often fail in ways impossible to predict (even given perfect info).&#10;Since they have in-built redundancies, when they do fail, they tend to fail in a catastrophic manner.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If the current Russian government ever does collapse, it likely won‚Äôt happen all at once.&#10;Small things, such as media control, will begin to fail first.&#10;This could be either through dissent/sabotage, neglect, or lack of attention as leaders are distracted by more urgent issues.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bbcanuck23 @TrentTelenko Yes. They can be successful in two ways:&#10;1. deforming or knocking off course to minimize damage, like a block in Karate or Judoü•ã&#10;2. causing explosive rounds to detonate a few milliseconds early, reducing their ability to function as designed --&amp;gt; reduced chance of penetration&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@johngineer @TrentTelenko Vendors have an incentive to over-state capabilities.&#10;Militaries have an incentive to under-state capabilities (or to over-state for deterrence, a-la Reagan‚Äôs ‚ÄòSDI‚Äô/‚ÄòStar Wars‚Äô or DPRK and Russia).&#10;ü§∑&#10;Actual field performance depends on many factors, and is likely classified.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bbcanuck23 @TrentTelenko They are single-use small ‚Äòpads‚Äô or bags seen tiled on the perimeter of some tanks.&#10;Filled with explosives (a ‚Äòshape charge‚Äô, I imagine, to direct energy outward), they explode when penetrated by a projectile (or jet from an anti-tank ‚ÄòHEAT‚Äô round) to try to deflect the attack.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@johngineer @TrentTelenko You‚Äôre probably thinking of the Excalibur (they‚Äôre only getting a small number of those), but with drone ISR repeated M795 hits can still be quite precise.&#10;If the get ahold of some of the precision course-correcting fuze attachments, all the better.&#10;‚ÄúMore bang for the buck.‚Äù‚Ñ¢&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@PLCount @1twittafae @kevin_cracknell @TheStudyofWar ‚Ä¶ and even those shaded areas may or may not be occupied by any significant force, depending on the day.&#10;Due to heavy use of ranged weaponry (‚Äòlong-range fires‚Äô, as the kids say), one would have to shrink nearly all of those borders by some number of kilometers to find troops.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EntierSpectre @kamilkazani It‚Äôs nice to know that some nations prioritize infrastructure.&#10;Since road maintenance (or any maintenance - see also urban trash pickup contracts) isn‚Äôt ‚Äòsexy‚Äô, and since government (and the press) generally don‚Äôt tend to have experience in those fields, graft is seldom noticed.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@kamilkazani Other possibilities?&#10;- Z is a ‚Äòsharp‚Äô, ‚Äòwarlike‚Äô shape with no soft edges like in ‚Äò–∑‚Äô. Likewise with ‚ÄòV‚Äô/‚Äò–í‚Äô.&#10;History: ‚ÄúOnly the form ÍôÅ was used in the oldest ustav writing.‚Äù&#10;‚ÄúThe shape of the letter originally looked similar to a Greek Zeta with a tail on the bottom (ÍôÅ).‚Äù&#10;&#10;@kamilkazani ‚Ä¶ and if one is trying to ‚Äòrestore the glory (and lands)‚Äô of a former empire, using antique/anachronistic forms of symbols or letters may seem logical to them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@UAWeapons In addition, by not sending those expensive electronic modules, the ‚Äòbook cost‚Äô of the transfer was likely reduced, which allowed the USG to instead send additional munitions and supplies within the current approved budget authority.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bear_Faced @ClavdiaMinor @sentdefender The compartment where the fire victims were found was not nearly completely flooded, right?&#10;As memory serves, there were three(?) major fatal events (the initial explosion, secondary explosions several minutes later (that killed most crew), and only hours later the fire).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@moscow_english @sentdefender It‚Äôs not _that_ small of an area.&#10;They‚Äôd all fit in a large-sized harbor.&#10;The Black Sea is has a _surface area_ of 168,500 mi¬≤, equal area to a square 410 miles on each side.&#10;(i.e. 436,400 km¬≤, equal area to a square 660 km on each side)&#10;Also, submarines operate in 3D space.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bear_Faced @ClavdiaMinor @sentdefender Yes, but if poor maintenance practices had not lead to that fire (oily bilge water causing self-ignition of chemical oxygen generator cartridges, if I recall correctly), those crew members could have survived until rescued.&#10;&#10;</description>
