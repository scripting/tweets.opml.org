			<description>@tipesca @Megamin91343928 @InnaSovsun It looks like a booster-stage rocket casing, as was seen with their cluster bomb missiles - the explosive payload likely continued onward towards its target with a second/third stage rocket motor.&#10;The minimal damage shown is solely due to the kinetic energy upon impact.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@cmvalentineb @ClaireBurdett @ninuxch @DirkStrongtall @ndcarson @kathrinpassig @teh_skullz @TrentTelenko Improved transmission capacity can mitigate much of the need for batteries, and will be needed anyway when fusion power becomes available in the 2050-2090 time frame.&#10;Spending the next 50 years improving grid infrastructure worldwide will pay dividends for our grandchildren.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TrentTelenko Does that not keep for more than one season if not planted now? (honest question - I’ve never farmed anything)&#10;Couldn’t at least some ‘EU-compatible’ seed corn that was needed be imported from elsewhere in the EU (or even from Russia, as part of some sort of reparations scheme)?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TrentTelenko It’s easy forget how large Ukraine actually is…&#10;… isn’t it plausible that the number of acres of farmland never even within shouting distance of military vehicles is at least an order of magnitude larger than the number _directly_ touched by forces from either side?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TrentTelenko There was reporting somewhere recently claiming Ukraine had stored wheat capacity to match last year’s export, and are actively shipping it via rail to Europe.&#10;As long as some supply lines remain open, they should be able to re-import some of that, right?&#10;&#10;@TrentTelenko If farmers worldwide did really plant extra wheat earlier this year due to high futures pricing, there’s a risk of a post-harvest oversupply, killing global wheat prices.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Did you or a friend see shocking news?&#10;Please sleep on it, or at least do some fact-checking, prior to sharing.&#10;“The war shortfall is 0.9% of the global wheat crop!&#10;Not 25%!” https://t.co/hl3IgVZpgS&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jrochest @mvhElmore @kamilkazani It’s an interesting strategy for purely industrial substations, though.&#10;Anti-drone defenses, in the rare places they exist, might ignore drones too small to carry significant explosives, for example, but if consumer-level drones could do something like this…&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@br92168132 @GwizoKeith @TrentTelenko You may also be interested in his (@kamilkazani’s) other recent threads, summarized here:&#10;(he also has an article, posted on his 2nd Substack site, called “Why is Russia so big?” - highly recommended, even for those deeply familiar with the region’s history) https://t.co/gNXh7QI33B&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@GwizoKeith @TrentTelenko Can you imagine how it would be received, during the war, if some Russian low-level enough to read even ‘suggested’ advice from the ‘West’?&#10;Best-case scenario is he’d be laughed off, or his superior would be punished for parroting propaganda.&#10;Russian military doesn’t have NCOs. https://t.co/471PzADIQM&#10;&#10;@GwizoKeith @TrentTelenko The Ukrainians aren’t giving up.&#10;&#10;If they were going to bow to a bully, they would have done so long before the indiscriminate shelling began.&#10;&#10;Russia will _eventually_ be partitioned by politics or a civil war. #Tatarstan&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@GwizoKeith @TrentTelenko Which project managers are going to arrange that?&#10;The ones who either didn’t exist or weren’t empowered to get things done before the invasion?&#10;It’s too late now to stop the bleeding, regardless of the money or bodies thrown at their quagmire.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Ian_Whitchurch @philologon @TrentTelenko If society is willing to support mobilization over short-term profits, absolutely!&#10;Arguably, that should have happened (with a WWII-level of funding, urgency, and shared sacrifice) with COVID-19 testing and vaccine production, but it didn’t.&#10;I sincerely hope we do better now.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@philologon @TrentTelenko Same problem with COVID-19 test and mask factories…&#10;… a new factory, even if it could magically appear overnight, would soon cause production to outstrip demand.&#10;They never recoup their their capital costs, to say nothing of making a long-term profit, therefore no factory.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@math4humans @411Beth @BeauTFC I’ve known that to happen with a different class of boat.&#10;Years ago, new sailor posted an article quoting a few specs from open / public sources. They did so _before reporting to the ship_, specifically to avoid that sort of allegation.&#10;It didn’t matter.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@HelicopterXP Probably an issue of distribution, too?&#10;Ukraine is a big country and logistics can be slow.&#10;To make the math simple, if you have 500 groups of soldiers around the country, and you want each group to have ten Javelins available over a 14-day period in case they come upon tanks?&#10;&#10;</description>

Was that due to an artillery shell, or just poor use of a winch?&#10;- multiple piles of what looks like trash (a pile of orange rinds?)… that’s no way to leave a campsite, soldier!&#10;#WheresWaldo&#10;&#10;@20user89 @soychicka @UAWeapons What if they just tied the thing to a tree with wire rope, in an attempt to pull it off of a truck-bed that they wanted to use for something else (e.g. escape)?&#10;&#10;</description>
