			<description>@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 I‚Äôm sure it can be flown in to airports without pipelines, but no idea what that adds to the cost.&#10;Does anyone know how western USA airports (especially in land-locked ones) get their fuel deliveries?&#10;Thinking of places such as MSP, SLC, DEN, BOI‚Ä¶&#10;‚Ä¶ oh, right‚Ä¶ rail. ü§¶&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 To your original question, though, wasn‚Äôt kerosene one of the earliest commercially refined hydrocarbons?&#10;&#10;Apparently it‚Äôs so insignificant that it gets lumped in with ‚Äúother oils‚Äù and isn‚Äôt otherwise mentioned in this report:&#10;&#10;https://t.co/tCueSa01Rk&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As often is the case, the futures markets know what‚Äôs coming before us mere mortals (back to using Diesel fuel as an example):&#10;&#10;Most airlines pre-purchase or otherwise hedge their fuel, as likely do militaries. Spot price purchases at the local FBO are at ones own peril. https://t.co/1wg1BAu9oC&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ManAboutCouch @avocadothethird @PhillipsPOBrien I believe the reporting from a few days ago was that not only had they not yet arrived, contract negotiations for the purchase had yet to be completed.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AbeFromanSox @ExtremelyTrains @RickPalaciosJr Homebuilding remains incredibly labor-intensive and resistant to automation.&#10;Apparently there are some in areas with short building seasons (e.g. Minnesota, USA) that factory-build wall panels (complete with insulation, piping, drywall, etc) to be crane-assembled on-site.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ExtremelyTrains @Bradorado1 @whitemice @RickPalaciosJr No one is offering them at a 2x salary multiplier as was common as little as 30 years ago, so that‚Äôs not incredibly surprising.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 It‚Äôs a complex system.&#10;The individual players operate on incomplete information.&#10;(example: refinery A sees excess capacity elsewhere in the market and decides not to expand, not knowing that some of that capacity is scheduled to go offline in 3-10 years)&#10;1/&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As long as prices are low / ‚Äòtimes are good‚Äô right now, it‚Äôs hard for voters prioritize an issue.&#10;&#10;When voters don‚Äôt care to prioritize an issue, it‚Äôs hard for politicians to care.&#10;&#10;2/3&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 Individual companies / governments try to manage their risks as much as possible, but that only goes so far.&#10;&#10;See also: progress on stopping global warming.&#10;&#10;3/3&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As far as ‚Äòadaptation‚Äô of individual trucks, though, not really.&#10;&#10;The current shortages should resolve due to normal market forces within 12‚Äì48 months.&#10;&#10;Long term, electrification and/or switching to hydrogen fuel will happen. (That‚Äôs 1‚Äì4 decades away, though.)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradorado1 @whitemice @ExtremelyTrains @RickPalaciosJr Smaller ranch style homes often necessitate more yard space to compensate for reduced indoor space (think: kids playroom vs yard swingset).&#10;More yard space means fewer lots / acre for the developer, which also lowers profits.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 Refineries have been closed all over the world over the past several years, due to various incentives.&#10;Political discourse was likely distracted by the pandemic? Tragedy of the commons?&#10;#NotAnExpert&#10;1/4&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 ‚ÄúIn the US, capacity has fallen by ~1mb/d since 2019, as (5 producers) jumped at government incentives to convert large oil refineries to very small bio-fuel refineries.‚Äù&#10;&#10;2/4&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 ‚ÄúIn Europe, Exxon shut the Slagen refinery in Norway, Gunvor shut two units in Rotterdam and one refinery in Antwerp, Total converted Grandpruits, Neste shut Naantali and Galp shut its Poro refinery.‚Äù&#10;&#10;3/4&#10;&#10;@Gigi_MCal @jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 ‚ÄúAll in the past two years.&#10;&#10;According to the IEA, global refinery closers outpaced capacity additions in 2021 for the first time in 30 years.‚Äù&#10;&#10;from: https://t.co/UGAlE40nM4&#10;&#10;4/4&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 The refinery issues are apparently diesel-specific (especially re: low-sulfur diesel) and have been building for several years (i.e. pre-pandemic), but to the extent that any kerosene-based fuels are transported by diesel-powered trucks or trains, yes.&#10;&#10;@jprupp @FreightAlley @EricRego8 As of 11 years ago, there was knowledge of potential #diesel supply issues.&#10;&#10;Today‚Äôs #DieselCrisis has been brewing for quite some time.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/dYYTB3Dxaq https://t.co/qTTt44QI81&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@slamastack The only safe tech for this sort of thing is legacy, open-standard tech such as #X10 or #Insteon and the modern (but much more complicated) #Zigbee or proprietary (#Zwave) equivalents.&#10;Worst-case, a hub might have to be replaced. My X-10 switches from the mid-90s still work!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DrKateJMiller @NatMorson My ADHD brain would probably have done great as a farmer in a pre-industrial world‚Ä¶ and likewise thrived in the strict structure of the military (as long as I was on duty).&#10;In the world in which we live, though, it needs medication (until better treatments are discovered).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LisaEsther6 @DrKateJMiller When it‚Äôs not caught until adulthood, there is a whole smorgasbord of learned coping mechanisms and maladaptive behaviors that need to be unraveled.&#10;That process isn‚Äôt quick or easy. üòû&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DrKateJMiller @CanadianKayMD I‚Äôve heard that until a decade or so ago, the common belief was that it was something kids outgrew by adulthood, so diagnosis was rarely sought or offered.&#10;It‚Äôs probably _vastly_ undiagnosed in people currently over age 30, and even more so for people over age 50.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ImALittleTeaPo9 @TrentTelenko I imagine they can type the coordinates manually into their system.

			<description>@nicholrr @TrentTelenko DD-459 was sunk at Guadalcanal.&#10;DD-724 was built two years later, and was also a former USS Laffey.&#10;DD-724 is the museum ship in SC next to the former USS Yorktown*.&#10;(That is CV-10, which itself was a replacement for an earlier ‚ÄòYorktown‚Äô, CV-5, that sank at Midway).&#10;&#10;</description>
