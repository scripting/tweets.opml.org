			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Indeed.&#10;Governments only exist with the consent of the governed, and societies only exist as long as their members stay together.&#10;Coercive force (physical, psychologic, economic, etc.) has sometimes worked to hold groups together, but only for a time.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux (That was not my intention but I understand that is how my comments may have been seen.)&#10;My opinion is irrelevant yet I have appreciated hearing yours.&#10;(Determining if there is a ‘right’ answer to that question seems quite academic as long as others have opposing views.)&#10;1/2&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux One must first agree with the premise of a question.&#10;&#10;As you said earlier, nearly anything can be turned into an advantage long-term.&#10;&#10;Since all diversity cannot be eliminated long-term, it seems prudent for societies to identify and mitigate the root causes of its problems.&#10;&#10;2/2&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Perhaps!&#10;Political borders are complex social constructs and sometimes deserve to be changed.&#10;The ‘state’ is also a construct. An outcome can be simultaneously detrimental to a ‘state’ and advantageous to the (former) citizens of that ‘state’. The inverse may be more common.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@FriedrichFiles @ThomasCatt1812 @amandalhu Units called ‘Heat Recovery Ventilators’ and ‘Energy Recovery Ventilators’ are available that allow ventilation with negligible increases in energy usage by transferring heat (#HRV) or heat+humidity (#ERV) between the stale and fresh air.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Something can be a short-term weakness while being a long-term strength.&#10;If I am overwhelmed at work, I can hire an apprentice. I may be at a short-term disadvantage by having to devote time to training, but in the long-term this type of investment clearly is a winner.&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Political borders cannot survive forever unchanged.&#10;&#10;If the ‘internal division’ from your hypothetical is problematic &amp;amp; persists for decades, perhaps the borders need to be updated.&#10;&#10;Groups can disband, groups can coalesce. Groups can migrate.&#10;&#10;Nature shows this on many scales.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Politically it’s a mess. That’s not organic, though.&#10;Having travelled _many_ places here, I’ve found people in each town are overwhelmingly just concerned with surviving.&#10;The economic inequality and ‘shocks’ (or fear thereof) cause the political strife, not the inverse.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Whether it is a strength, a weakness, or neither/both seems to be a distraction (and perhaps unanswerable in a general sense for now).&#10;As with anything, one can aim to embrace beneficial factors and mitigate non-beneficial ones.&#10;In which circumstances was diversity a weakness?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien The facts on the ground are often quite different from the political and media discourse.&#10;(if racial discontent was ubiquitous it wouldn’t, by definition, be ‘news’)&#10;People have far more in common than not, and most will admit that in private conversation.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Race, after all, is a social construct.&#10;&#10;Racism generally appears in places where people do not feel secure, either physically, socially, or economically.&#10;&#10;A century ago, Italians were seen as the ‘other’ in the US. Any differences can be scary, especially when times are tough.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien If the poor people of &amp;lt;insert group here&amp;gt; are scary, but a wealthy and well educated member of that same group is not…&#10;&#10;… then the root fear is likely not of some grouping of people based on arbitrary characteristics, but rather due to the underlying assumptions being assigned.&#10;&#10;@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien Anti-migrant sentiments occur when political power or financial power is threatened.&#10;&#10;To a hypothetical nation of 100 million people, an influx of 1 million migrants (1%) is not a fear of (e.g.) ‘brown people’ but of ‘poor people’.&#10;&#10;Would they reject 20 million rich migrants?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux That there are only ‘two sides’ to any issue is a very dangerous mindset.&#10;(that’s not an indictment of your comment, just a general statement)&#10;Nature is probably the best example of ‘diversity’ in action (in terms of ‘evidence’), though.&#10;Consider the Irish potato famine.&#10;&#10;@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux Since diversity in any complex system cannot ever be completely and sustainably eliminated, the most logical course is to embrace (or at least accept) that eventually.&#10;&#10;Any challenges can then be addressed head-on and based on their merits (rather than trying to assign blame).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@OliusThe @PhillipsPOBrien The ‘cultural narratives’ of the 90s and 2000s weren’t healthy, either.&#10;The majority of the politically powerful grew up in time where resources were abundant, education was nearly free, and yet were unhappy.&#10;It’s not that I’m saying they were spoiled, over-entitled, children… https://t.co/SdPk3fYzTv&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JohnHBillings @EliNew18 @Viking95 @BretDevereaux The Roman Empire could also be a vastly different society from one century to the next.&#10;Perhaps time/fate caught up with them, or perhaps by the end they lost sight of some of the qualities that made them once so adaptable.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EliNew18 @Viking95 @BretDevereaux Give us a generation and check back, please.&#10;The elders who remembered the hardships of hunger and war are gone.&#10;Much of the current ‘ruling class’ matured during a time of great abundance and are now somewhat set in their ways of thinking.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Bradninchfellow @BretDevereaux If a place such as Lebanon magically became homogeneous, would all of its problems disappear?&#10;(I don’t actually know, of course)&#10;Diversity is often used as a target of blame when things are not going well with a society.&#10;Blame neighboring nations for ones intractable problems?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@IainBancarz @BurtWestermeier @BretDevereaux … and at the same time too large.&#10;If Malta instead had decided to leave the EU, they likely could have obtained better trade arrangements than the UK, because their economy is so much smaller; less of an economic threat/competitor.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@BurtWestermeier @BretDevereaux Very small, very large, or very remote seem to be the ‘sweet spots’ for stability.&#10;Switzerland, for example, is quite insular (… and holds defensible ground).&#10;A small city-state (such as Singapore, Monaco, etc) is less of a threat to others, and less of a prize to conquerors.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@QuercusCirratus @BretDevereaux That was a shameful and un-repented sin, yes.&#10;It was likely enabled by a lack of diversity among the powerful at the time.&#10;The pendulum between diversity and homogeneity swings over time; looking back it becomes clear which brings the most long-term piece and prosperity.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LaGazzettaEuro @AsaZernik @BretDevereaux The general population in the United States is also poorer than it was in the 1970s.&#10;…blaming immigration or globalization (for the United States) is a distraction; a magician’s slight-of-hand.&#10;There has been a general (worldwide) increase in income equality in recent decades.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LaGazzettaEuro @AsaZernik @BretDevereaux One would imagine suicide bombers tend to choose that path because the perceived benefits exceed the costs.&#10;Why do they feel they have nothing left to loose?&#10;That question would be uncomfortable for any society.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @britinvan @KiarKini @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock Previous major societal collapses happened in a different world, though.&#10;Today, even peasants can receive near instantaneous news from the other side of the planet.&#10;Young people in isolated and poor places (i.e. Nepal) have more options than ever.&#10;Uncharted territory this is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock If Russia successfully breaks into pieces, the Basques might be inspired.&#10;Perhaps the Scots.&#10;Perhaps the Kurds.&#10;Andalusians. Balochs. Hmong. Palestinians. Rohingya. Uyghurs. Zulu.&#10;There will be an _enormous_ amount of elite pressure (worldwide) to prevent that idea spreading.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@chumak_iryna @KiarKini @britinvan @francis_scarr @KevinRothrock The collapse of the USSR was rather orderly compared to what _could_ happen to the Russian Federation, though.&#10;If the Russian economy collapses before the government does, perhaps the chaos following the fall of Rome might be a better precedent?&#10;&#10;</description>
