			<description>&lt;p&gt;@UAWeapons I don&amp;#39;t think it missed. There seems to be a smoking hole on the second tank on the side opposite the DM-22 and the crew seems to be bailing out at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto At least the swing states change occasionally. Kinda like those rotating seats on the UN Security Council. But NY, CA, FL, and TX would be permanent members.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@thexiv @b05crypto And he lost the 2016 popular vote by almost 2 million votes. So yeah, let&amp;#39;s see how you come up with &amp;quot;70%&amp;quot;, please!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@thexiv @b05crypto Funny how that&amp;#39;s not true. Trump lost the popular vote in 2020 by 7.5 million votes. Or did you miss that part?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto That means presidents will only have to care about campaigning in NY, CA, FL, TX, and maybe PA or OH. Is that really what we want? Because I&amp;#39;d like a president that cares about stuff from the other 45 states, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@onewayfunction @semenov_roman_ @github That&amp;#39;s a clearer way to say it. Your previous comment was ambiguous and seemed to imply that Github had some moral or legal obligation to host it. They&amp;#39;re Microsoft, so you know that&amp;#39;s not the case...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@siegel I drove a manual transmission car for the first 17 years of my driving career. After flinging untold numbers of ice cream cones into the floorboard while shifting, I&amp;#39;m happy to have 2 more free appendages. Three if autopilot is behaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto Unless @AndrewYang has some inside info on what those documents contain, he should sit quietly and wait for the other shoe to drop. Given Trump&amp;#39;s close ties to Saudi Arabia and Russia, who knows? He could have been selling them those documents or sharing them with golf buddies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MoonPie Every moonpie ever eaten goes through a &amp;quot;waning gibbous&amp;quot; phase. Unless a particularly big bite sends it directly to a &amp;quot;crescent&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@onewayfunction @semenov_roman_ @github Github is a private company. Your definition of &amp;quot;speech&amp;quot; is not relevant.
