			<description>@willie In one case, maybe. The problem is that the cost of keeping two separate dev teams and tool chains and build processes and QA skills doesn't make business sense in many cases. If there were better cross-platform solutions, that's one way to ensure platform parity.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@willie It's possible that companies aren't interested in spending the same amount of $$$ on engineering to support a unique platform with only 10% market share as one with 90%. Maybe Apple should make a better version of Electron instead of pushing devs toward niche tools like Swift?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@siegel That whole video made me cringe for the better part of an hour. It was 15 minutes worth of content with scripted gestures, contrived CGI, bad music, and plastic presenters filling the rest. I hope Apple doesn't ever do that again.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@brentsimmons Any tool or service that helps the free and unhindered dissemination of news and information to Russia is a service to all mankind. Pulling it is not only a &quot;me too&quot; gestures, but one that damages the ability for the truth to be know.  Stop overthinking this and leave it alone!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@b05crypto Save your breath. People like @SenWarren  are fear mongering for personal gain, pandering to a group of financial Luddites in an echo chamber that they can't hear reason in. She doesn't WANT to understand as it would show she's been wrong all along.&#10;&#10;</description>
