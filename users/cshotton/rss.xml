			<description>@peternlewis @apple wants you to keep that confusion. Keep all those old videos and pics in those messages because why would you want to ever save them in Photos? I saved 4gb of iCloud storage deleting old convos, for example.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@nftwriternft @JoshuaLisec Oh, so you are one of those people who supports kleptocrats, grifters, nepotists, and other &quot;defenders&quot; of the Constitution in office, I suppose?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@peternlewis Yeah, and NOWHERE does Apple document this and there's no way to turn it off. Completely shitty attempt to force people into paying for extra storage. Took me a month to track down why I couldn't back my phone up anymore. Bastards.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Dan79901561 @GAResistance93 @spook_info @AmericanPartis1 And you're apparently confused about Ukraine's independence as a sovereign nation of you think that it's someone's &quot;responsibility&quot; here in the US. What a facile (or maybe fascist) world view you have fabricated for yourself.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Dan79901561 @GAResistance93 @spook_info @AmericanPartis1 I know it wasn't the orange guy who tried to hold up Congressionally allocated funds for Ukrainian defense by illegally tying it to making the Ukrainian government dig up dirt on his political rival, was it? Surely it was someone more ethical than that. Can I have a hint?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Dan79901561 @spook_info @AmericanPartis1 Yeah, except the difference is that officials from the National Archives hauled 20+ boxes out of Trump's possession, many of which were clearly marked Top Secret, but no one's actually seen this mythical laptop. So fantasy vs. reality I guess. Keep hopin', MAGA!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Dan79901561 @spook_info @AmericanPartis1 Maybe it's more likely to be something about a former president stealing and/or destroying classified documents. Remember when that happened?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@willie But are they capable enough? A lot of these companies demonstrate repeatedly that they don't really have strong technical teams. All you'd get is a bad native application. Seriously, Apple would do indie iOS/macOS devs a big favor by making cross-platform better and easier.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@willie In one case, maybe. The problem is that the cost of keeping two separate dev teams and tool chains and build processes and QA skills doesn't make business sense in many cases. If there were better cross-platform solutions, that's one way to ensure platform parity.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@willie It's possible that companies aren't interested in spending the same amount of $$$ on engineering to support a unique platform with only 10% market share as one with 90%. Maybe Apple should make a better version of Electron instead of pushing devs toward niche tools like Swift?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@siegel That whole video made me cringe for the better part of an hour. It was 15 minutes worth of content with scripted gestures, contrived CGI, bad music, and plastic presenters filling the rest. I hope Apple doesn't ever do that again.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@brentsimmons Any tool or service that helps the free and unhindered dissemination of news and information to Russia is a service to all mankind. Pulling it is not only a &quot;me too&quot; gestures, but one that damages the ability for the truth to be know.  Stop overthinking this and leave it alone!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@b05crypto Save your breath. People like @SenWarren  are fear mongering for personal gain, pandering to a group of financial Luddites in an echo chamber that they can't hear reason in. She doesn't WANT to understand as it would show she's been wrong all along.&#10;&#10;</description>
