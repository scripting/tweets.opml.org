			<description>&lt;p&gt;@rudytheelder Well, that&amp;#39;s a good point. But you probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be wrong to just sprinkle a few more red-shifted galaxies in there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@rudytheelder And here I was thinking that someone was just adding cheesy Photoshop filters to make the stars look fancy. Seems like they could remove those with a little software work...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@sauldraws Usually, too much salt in brownies gives them that &amp;quot;Play-Doh&amp;quot; flavor (which I find... unappealing). In fact, you shouldn&amp;#39;t even use salted butter in brownies to avoid that. Saul, are you telling us you like to eat Play-Doh....?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@rudytheelder Would be interesting for their thought processes to happen at vastly different speeds, or perhaps she&amp;#39;s schizophrenic because her personality bubbles up from places light years apart.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@willie I mean, is that even a fair question? C is probably the only language that you&amp;#39;ll have universal runtime support for across all the different platforms. You can&amp;#39;t assume the rest would even work stand-alone, much less linked into another app.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
