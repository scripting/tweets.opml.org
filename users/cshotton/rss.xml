			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto Um, yeah. It just requires a more complicated solution that a lot of devs can tackle. So they launch servers and hope no one notices the failure points they&amp;#39;ve introduced.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto Ugh. *can&amp;#39;t.   (The inability to edit tweets is a constant irritant.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@tomsietsema @ChefAnthonyDC Good fried chicken is so hard to find around here for some reason. Chain chicken, Korean BBQ, nuggets galore. But no good, southern fried chicken.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@SenatorDoctor1 @MaxNordau How, exactly, do you repossess an education if the person with the loan defaults? Yeah, see? They&amp;#39;re not like mortgages. They&amp;#39;re like grants from the government. Just like PPP. Care to try again?.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto @brave Biggest problem for me with @Brave is there seems to be no reasonable way to get it to stop launching itself when you boot up your Mac. VERY obnoxious behavior. I just deleted it to make it stop. Consider that, @Brave.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@CantoPublic Are there any known issues with contract verification on the block explorer? Been watching the &amp;quot;Loading...&amp;quot; button for about an hour and not sure if it is verifying, or just silently judging me.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@rudytheelder I thought for a sec that just the saucer&amp;#39;s windshield had popped into your yard&amp;#39;s dimension. The photo is kinda cool if you parse it that way!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@UAWeapons I don&amp;#39;t think it missed. There seems to be a smoking hole on the second tank on the side opposite the DM-22 and the crew seems to be bailing out at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto At least the swing states change occasionally. Kinda like those rotating seats on the UN Security Council. But NY, CA, FL, and TX would be permanent members.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@thexiv @b05crypto And he lost the 2016 popular vote by almost 2 million votes. So yeah, let&amp;#39;s see how you come up with &amp;quot;70%&amp;quot;, please!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@thexiv @b05crypto Funny how that&amp;#39;s not true. Trump lost the popular vote in 2020 by 7.5 million votes. Or did you miss that part?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto That means presidents will only have to care about campaigning in NY, CA, FL, TX, and maybe PA or OH. Is that really what we want? Because I&amp;#39;d like a president that cares about stuff from the other 45 states, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@onewayfunction @semenov_roman_ @github That&amp;#39;s a clearer way to say it.

They&amp;#39;re Microsoft, so you know that&amp;#39;s not the case...&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@siegel I drove a manual transmission car for the first 17 years of my driving career. After flinging untold numbers of ice cream cones into the floorboard while shifting, I&amp;#39;m happy to have 2 more free appendages. Three if autopilot is behaving.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@b05crypto Unless @AndrewYang has some inside info on what those documents contain, he should sit quietly and wait for the other shoe to drop. Given Trump&amp;#39;s close ties to Saudi Arabia and Russia, who knows? He could have been selling them those documents or sharing them with golf buddies.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
