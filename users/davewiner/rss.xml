			<description>I think this is what you'll regret at 80.&#10;That you aren't 20.&#10;&#10;And btw it's because sex is great at 20.&#10;&#10;So if you're 20 you should do a lot of that.&#10;&#10;At least it'll make you smile when you're 80 (I imagine).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ElieNYC The same country absorbed over 1 million deaths from Covid, many of which were preventable, maybe all of them.&#10;&#10;@ElieNYC The problem imho is that we're organized to be stupid, politically, no one has invested in making us organized intelligently, even those of us who are curious, educated, who want to do good. Our only outlet is to give money and vote.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DBaird13 The thing that really gives me pride is that it can serve as an example to young developers that their work can make a difference, and it isn't all about making huge piles of money.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I hear someone talk about podcasting in such a mainstream way I feel a sense of accomplishment.&#10;Podcasting made a difference. It worked. ;-) https://t.co/SrN7Q34cJE&#10;&#10;Evan Williams and the team at Blogger should feel that pride too, Twitter made a big difference. Yes he got a few billion more dollars than I did, but I never cared about money beyond enough to buy my own freedom, which I got before the web became a thing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is outrageous. It's fine if Justice Kavanaugh feels so empowered to force women to carry pregnancy to term, or even give up their lives, but he should get ready for lots of &quot;politics,&quot; and forget out a nice dinner out with the family. That part of his life is over. https://t.co/8oMKmrVmEZ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/2 I didn't watch the conference with @semaforben, but I sure heard a lot about it -- and it seems they're missing the big niche that none of the pubs old or new seem interested in. It's the idea I gave the @martinn123 in 2001, find all the sources, people with expertise and&#10;&#10;2/2 give them a home. We already have too many legit journalism outlets competing to be number one, how about something truly different, instead of all the news that's fit to print, or democracy dies in darkness, make your mission to save the world.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>The other day I replied to a tweet by a famous  columnist and even though the trolls couldn't reply, a  number of them did QT it with the usual crap. Then I remembered I had turned the quality filter off. I turned it on and they went away. As if they never existed.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW -- to @twitterdev -- is there an API for Notes? This is a crucial question. If yes, then devs will be able to hook great editorial tools to Twitter in ways no one has been able to do before. It will open so many doors not just for Twitter, but for the entire net.&#10;&#10;My writeup of Twitter Notes, based on seeing one in the wild.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/Nn8chXmoV6&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have finally seen a Twitter Note in the wild. I like everything I see, but how it presents in the Twitter timeline.&#10;I suggest that presenting notes as they present an image or video -- inline.&#10;I did a mockup of how this would work...&#10;https://t.co/g7spyCtQ4P&#10;&#10;The way they present it now, i think most users will see the links to notes as they see all other links, not worth the trouble. By putting it inline, they start reading, and when they want more, they just click the more link.&#10;&#10;There's great prior art for this -- Facebook. It works there, it would work great on Twitter.&#10;&#10;I would use the feature and provide the highest quality technical feedback. I have decades of experience at this, esp in this area, having written the first blogging tools.&#10;&#10;</description>
