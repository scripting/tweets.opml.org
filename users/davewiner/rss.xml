			<description>Have you noticed that TVs don't have brightness controls anymore. It sucks -- it's hard to watch during the day.&#10;Now I'm using my Lenovo Chromebook outdoors at a Starbucks. Can't find anyway to increase brightness. Very hard to read the screen.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<title>Was 2-factor such a good idea?</title>
			<description>Now that all our services use our phones to allow us to connect to our accounts, what happens if you lose your phone? I don't mean just the physical phone, what if you lose control of the number? It can happen.&#10;&#10;I'm thinking of switching carriers, but do I dare? What if the number gets lost in the transition. All of a sudden I can't get to anything.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<title>Two-way RSS</title>
			<description>I'm thinking a lot about RSS this year, specifically RSS going in both directions. Apps that can read RSS and also write RSS.&#10;&#10;As a reader, I have no problem with a publishing site like [Substack](https://t.co/MCOiYl6ihr) only doing outbound RSS. All my reading tools can hook into their authors' writing. It's good.&#10;&#10;But as a writer, I can't use a system that doesn't do inbound RSS. It's the inverse of the silo problem.&#10;&#10;Such a site insists that I do all my writing on there. That's a deal-stopper because I already have my best writing tool and I do all my serious writing in that tool.  It's as if a radio station insisted that I use their guitar to play music.&#10;&#10;Someday we'll look back on this practice and think how could we have missed something so obvious.&#10;I've asked writers who use Substack how they feel about this, with mixed results. None of the writers are thinking about it very much, apparently.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Putin said something in the lead-up to the war in Ukraine. I'm paraphrasing.&#10;He said he can buy any western politician he wants.&#10;If true, that explains a lot of what we see happening in US politics.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Dear twitter, I'm working on a new product, and twitter is rejecting links to the site because it thinks it's a malware site. It's a brand new domain, didn't exist two weeks ago. There's no malware. What can be done to fix this??&#10;&#10;</description>
