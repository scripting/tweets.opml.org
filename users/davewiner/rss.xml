			<description>&lt;p&gt;@Gartenberg i had a pretty huge problem with experian myself. it had to do with them being hacked and offering a free service to monitor my credit rating, when the free service expired, all of a sudden experian wouldn&amp;#39;t rate me, and that set off flags when i got a mortgage for my new house.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@Gartenberg i tried and tried to get them to believe i was me, but they wouldn&amp;#39;t and didn&amp;#39;t respond, no human contact.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;then i got solicited by them on the phone, and i asked if they could fix the problem and the person did it and all of a sudden they will rate me again.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@Gartenberg this became a real problem when i bought a house and needed to get a mortgage. i have really good credit, never have missed a payment, but it was a pain in the ass and i paid more than i should have had to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>This doesn't work</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay -- Trump doesn&amp;#39;t play by the rules of journalism. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;He doesn&amp;#39;t explain why he had the stolen documents.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;His only response is to flood the zone with bullshit as Bannon says.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The Dems on the other hand accept the rules of journalism, which over decades has come to mean avoid saying anything, so everything Dems say comes out more and more like mush. They work hard to say nothing for fear of provoking a new scandal in the press.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;We view what Trump does negatively, but what about the other journalism as the sole judge approach? It doesn&amp;#39;t work any better for us, in fact you&amp;#39;d have to say at this time that approach is losing. We&amp;#39;re one election away from becoming an openly fascist country.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s why, sorry to say -- I&amp;#39;m not sad to see the enforcers of journalism at CNN and other news orgs get fired. Because the system they are enforcing is flushing our system down the toilet. And the system, even though it&amp;#39;s fucked up, is better than having no system at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I wonder if the big journalism thinkers think this idea deserves to be part of the mix. You never see it on the op-ed pages, or part of the discussion on The Beat with Ari Melber. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The people who own the news orgs don’t care what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;If Reliable Sources was looking out for us, and not just keeping the bosses happy, there would be more people who care it was shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;When NYT reporters cover Trump’s ass, they’re just making sure he’s happy so he’ll keep talking to them. This is called “access” and it’s why you never get the truth about famous people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<title>DNS and Ethereum</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I just got an email that looked interesting about hooking Ethereum up to DNS. Sounds more pragmatic than most such ideas. Would anything be gained from this?
