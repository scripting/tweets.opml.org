			<description>Ending Roe v Wade will end the United States.&#10;The world is built around reproductive freedom, led by the United States. A country that repeals such a fundamental right no longer is, imho, the United States.&#10;Where we go from there I don't know.&#10;&#10;One thing's for sure -- we can't let the Supreme Court actually do it.&#10;&#10;I didn't think Obama would let them steal the seat of Merrick Garland.&#10;&#10;Then I didn't think Obama would let Trump take office.&#10;&#10;Suspend the Supreme Court now. Stop them from releasing this decision.&#10;&#10;Let's talk about Merrick Garland.&#10;&#10;The Senate's role is to &quot;advise and consent&quot; not to impede. When it became clear they would not even hold hearings on Garland, interpret that as approval. Tell Mr Garland to report for work. Secret Service escorts him to his office.&#10;&#10;And yes, I said this is what Obama should've done at the time. But Obama wasn't going to do anything remotely like that. The best he could do was give Putin the evil eye. https://t.co/qNUdS84oTt&#10;&#10;I try to think back to a president would have seated Garland even though he hadn't been approved by the Senate.&#10;&#10;Eisenhower would have done it for sure. And JFK, Johnson, Nixon, Reagan after that, hmm, not so sure.&#10;&#10;What's wrong with the wimp/idiots we elect as president.&#10;&#10;People would've been talking about that, instead of Hillary's Fucking Emails.&#10;&#10;So how do I know Eisenhower would've done it.&#10;&#10;Remember Little Rock?&#10;&#10;That was a moment to be PROUD of America.&#10;&#10;We told the segregationists to fuck off.&#10;&#10;Which btw led to desegregation all over the country. https://t.co/9vjO53epaY&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>&quot;Web3&quot; is as if there was a new band called Beatles 3, and they didn't play music, they just held up instruments and said &quot;It would be great if we knew what these were.&quot;&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Message at this year's Davos.&#10;You didn't understand the web and it made mega billions.&#10;So here's a new web, called &quot;Web3&quot; -- you don't understand it, of course (frankly neither do we) but this time you must invest so *you* make the billions!&#10;They will love it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have a Tesla, bought it in November, love driving it.&#10;Itâ€™s like having a Mac in 1984. You may not like Steve Jobs, but you need to have it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you're a hippyish boomer, ask your speaker to play WDST now. They're playing protest songs from the 60s and 70s. Really emotional stuff.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jessegrosjean @royalicing For now that's a perfect place.&#10;I want to do some cleaning up and organizing of my OPML-related repos. I've left a trail of development projects with somewhat confusing names.&#10;But I am slowly sorting things out. Feel free to ask about anything that seems weird. :-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jessegrosjean @royalicing Not sure what you all are talking about but yes, coordination between apps is great. And it's great that you are driving this, even in a small way.&#10;For a long time, I've been the only evangelist for OPML, as far as I know (and I guess I would).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jessegrosjean Also Drummer's native file format is OPML, so why isn't it in your first category.&#10;And there's LO2 -- https://t.co/p9lLJC2cOV&#10;People still use it, it came before Drummer, and its native file format is also OPML.&#10;&#10;@jessegrosjean Jesse, I noted that you added LO2 and Electric Drummer to the list, and thanks for that! ;-)&#10;&#10;But both belong in your first category, they read and write OPML files, it's their native format.&#10;&#10;When you choose File/New it creates and OPML file.&#10;&#10;</description>
