			<description>@jessegrosjean @chriseidhof @WorkFlowy @checkvist_news I'm glad to see you're supporting OPML as a native file format. We should test to see if it interops my Drummer, my latest outliner, whose native format is OPML.&#10;https://t.co/jBvvd07MwT&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote Maybe a subset of this will prove useful? A plug-in that creates an OPML version of your current outline that can then be plugged into anything that handles OPML, fir example every RSS reader.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Okay Leon Muks is a Republican.&#10;Someone should find out if he's anti-abortion.&#10;He should probably go into hiding for a while.&#10;I liked him better when I didn't know he's a fascist.&#10;&#10;One more thing..&#10;&#10;ðŸ’©&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>So I bought an expensive Bose speaker to play Alexa, and the thing delegates to other Alexas in my house. If I say &quot;Alexa WNYC&quot; nothing comes out of the Bose speaker but the other three Alexas in my house start playing WNYC. And the sound is kind of like the $40 speaker I bought.&#10;&#10;It took 1/2 hour to set up and update, and I had to give it access to everything just to get to Hello World, and after a couple of minutes, I think it's going back.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I just bought an expensive product from Bose.&#10;But before it'll do anything I have to create an account.&#10;It seems that should have been in their advertising.&#10;&#10;And now it's updating itself. Oy. They need to work on the instant gratification thing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@verycoolhacker I like that OPML is its native file format.&#10;Same with https://t.co/jBvvd07MwT&#10;The two apps should be able to work on the same files.&#10;Very nice!&#10;I wish my friends in #toolsforthought world would do that too. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If Twitter had a Steve Jobs type leader he'd come up with a brilliant idea, akin to noise-cancelling headphones (and call it that), and explain how satisfying it can be to tell the trolls to shut the fuck up.&#10;Ahhhh nice and quiet.&#10;&#10;I used to live on noisy streets in Palo Alto and Berkeley.&#10;&#10;I moved to NYC, even worse (I lived in the west village, then the east village) until I moved uptown and then ahhh nice and quiet.&#10;&#10;Moved to the mountains, even better!&#10;&#10;There's something to be said for a little peace.&#10;&#10;Here's how I made my twtr quiet. At the first sign of trollish behavior, I mute or block. Works great.&#10;&#10;The trollish behavior is basically anyone who wants to argue with you. People who say unfair things and you want to point out how unfair they are.&#10;&#10;If you find yourself protesting, the chances you're communicating with a troll approach 100 percent.&#10;&#10;To determine if the person conversing with you is a troll, look at your own feelings. If you feel they misunderstand you and want to correct them -- it's a troll.&#10;&#10;We've learned so much about trolls.&#10;&#10;Trolls aren't nearly as frustrating as newbies who refuse to turn them off and insist on setting them straight FOR ALL TO SEE.&#10;&#10;Ohhh, that's exactly what they want.&#10;&#10;And btw, in 2022, the entire Republican Party platform is trolling.&#10;&#10;Whoever runs Twitter needs the sass of Steve Jobs with his incredible ability to make simple ideas simple.&#10;&#10;Noise-cancelling headphones for Twitter.&#10;&#10;Instead of focusing on trying to diminish the brightness of the sun, give everyone sunglasses.&#10;&#10;I think I'll add another tweet.&#10;&#10;A Repub is someone who likes to troll Libs.&#10;&#10;A Lib is someone who thinks Repubs want to know why they're wrong.&#10;&#10;One of the coolest things about the web is that people do tutorials with videos showing how they do things like install a new antenna on your roof, or put together an Adirondack chair. When people bad mouth the web, they forget about miracles like that.&#10;&#10;That said, there must be videos that demo how to shut down the trolls yourself.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I've hoped that even though Elon Musk was a partner of Peter Thiel in Paypal, that he didn't have the same disgusting nazi-like politics as Thiel. Give him the benefit of the doubt. Hope for the best. But it's becoming harder to give him that benefit.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/4 Software is easy to debug if you treat it like anything else.&#10;&#10;2/4 If you have what you think is a bad light bulb, but when you put a new bulb in the socket it doesn't work, you'd conclude the problem was in the socket, not the bulb.&#10;&#10;3/4 (Although it doesn't hurt to try a third bulb from a different pack if possible. Sometimes two bulbs are broken.)&#10;&#10;4/4 Debugging a problem in software is usually just a series of those kinds of tests.&#10;&#10;</description>
