			<description>I wish the Dems had prepared for this moment. They had the time. The best they can come up with is &quot;Vote?&quot; Really. We voted Obama into the presidency and he let the Repubs steal a judge from us. What good does voting do if the people we elect won't fight!&#10;&#10;When the Dems say vote it's like the power industry saying we (you and I) need to conserve. As if it's our fault that they want to keep killing our environment.&#10;&#10;Same with the Dems. I guess it's our fault because we didn't vote, right? Is that why abortion is illegal now?&#10;&#10;Right. Fuck you Democrats. We elected you to protect Roe v Wade and to regulate guns. In two days we lose on both, and you have the audacity to BLAME VOTERS!&#10;&#10;FUCK YOU. I've had it with Democrats.&#10;&#10;Instead of telling us to vote, tell us how you're going to force every Repub running for re-election to explain what they're going to do to restore Roe. They should be asked this question at every stop. When they go out to dinner or show up at the airport going to Cancun.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ElieNYC I wish you would publish it. Now so people understand what just happened.&#10;I bet the Repubs have prepared for this, and have a few choice soundbites ready to go.&#10;Should we be reduced to shouting &quot;They're lying!&quot;&#10;Gotta get out in front if just a little.&#10;You have it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AdamSinger i think people would have to nominate them for it to work. if so, the twitter api has enough functionality it seems to me (always have to hedge re possible deal stoppers).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Earlier today before the decision was announced, I explained how the democrats must change. Staying the course will not work. It was a mistake as early as 2016 to let the new repubs ride, but now it's way past time to take the gloves off.&#10;https://t.co/eAp5sCpRzS&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>We should consider ignoring the Supreme Court from now on. Declare the Constitution defunct, and go on from there. One side respecting the Constitution and the other side ignoring it is not a workable situation.&#10;&#10;I am not a legal scholar, but&#10;&#10;1. the 9th amendment says 'the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'&#10;&#10;So abortion doesn't have to be in the Constitution for it to be a right.&#10;&#10;2. the 2nd amendment begins 'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..'&#10;&#10;the amendment was meant to quell slave uprisings, and we in theory no longer have slaves, but this part is always ignored by republicans on the court.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Politically, tag every Republican candidate for *anything* with this decision. It's a referendum on freedom. The Repubs, each and every one of them, are on the wrong side of this. Make them defend it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Obama didn't have to accept what the Repubs tried to do to Merrick Garland. He could have waited a decent amount of time for the Senate to advise and consent, assume they consented, and walked Garland, himself (with the Secret Service) over to the Supreme Court to take his seat.&#10;&#10;RBG was sick, and the chances of her dying were too high for her to stay on the court past Obama's tenure.&#10;&#10;Had Garland been seated, and RBG replaced with a moderate, and assuming Trump had been elected and his nominees confirmed, the court would now be 4-3-2* which is a pretty good configuration, much better than the 6-3 disaster we're dealing with now.&#10;&#10;* 4 conservatives, 3 liberals, 2 centrists.&#10;&#10;Now the Democrats have to do something bold and risky in response. No more playing it safe, as is their approach up till now.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @pilhofer @froomkin Jeff exactly right. No one would trust Google, but we trust Amazon with exactly that service. It's what they do. Manage retail's money and make it possible to live in the mountains (as I do) without having to go to Target or Home Depot.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @pilhofer @froomkin But the NYT would squawk at the WP taking over the economics of news for everyone but the NYT (who would be welcome but who'd be the last to join as Walmart has resisted Amazon).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@pilhofer @froomkin The opportunity for an Amazon For News is enormous and could solve a big problem -- paying for news without subscribing. Think about all the ways Amazon does that for retailers (I buy everything I can through Amazon for many years, so I'm pretty well schooled in their abilities).&#10;&#10;@pilhofer @froomkin Most important -- they could make our EZ Pass For News. Make it so I can read New Yorker articles and run up a huge monthly bill with absolutely no commitment.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/B6QPHKwqE9&#10;&#10;There's no reason to assume they'd make less money from me, they'd probably make more.&#10;&#10;</description>
