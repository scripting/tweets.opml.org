			<description>@MrChuckD @Jason @KnicksFanTv I think what people are saying is we like exciting basketball. The Miami fourth quarter was incredible. There was a lot of love on the court.&#10;&#10;@MrChuckD @Jason @KnicksFanTv And... we don't like what Randle has been bringing.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/K21CsRqSWq&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@GaboHBeaumont @elonmusk you can put a title on a post or not, it's up to the author.&#10;this post does not have a title. no need for it.&#10;but a longer post could use a title. it's part of the written human language.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@elonmusk -- if you do a new social network, please make sure it supports posts with optional titles, simple styling, links, and RSS in and out. these are the things that are missing that make it impossible for networks to interop. And if you want free speech interop is a must.&#10;&#10;it's not a dig at twitter. i'm a professional and i do a lot of development work assuming twitter's existence. i'm also a twtr shareholder, btw.&#10;&#10;any network that doesn't allow peering is going to be under the same kind of political pressure twitter is to ban unpopular people.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Defunding Fox News is an essential first step to maing America strong.&#10;President Biden could declare an emergency executive order. Say the truth about Fox. They are deliberately weakening America when we need to be strong.&#10;We need to sanction Fox News like we sanction Russia.&#10;&#10;maing == making&#10;&#10;Two comments to the commenters:&#10;&#10;1. The constitution is not a suicide pact.&#10;&#10;2. I pay for Fox News because I have a cable subscription. Let's start there. I don't want to pay that money. An executive order could say I don't have to.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Whenever a pundit criticizes Biden on TV, a little voice in my head asks: &quot;Compared to what?&quot; We've had the comparison, you know. Four harrowing years of it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/7 So much disappointment in what Biden said about Putin. As I've said, I don't care. Putin has to go, whether or not Biden said it out loud.&#10;&#10;2/7 But there's a much more dangerous despot-in-waiting here in the good old US of A.&#10;&#10;3/7 He tried to overthrow the government and came incredibly close to doing it.&#10;&#10;4/7 I remember while it was going on, wondering if the entire US Congress was being executed while we were watching the riot. If the attackers had been somewhat better organized, that's exactly what would have been going on. And how would our country ever recover from that.&#10;&#10;5/7 Aside: No one scanned them for weapons as they entered the Capitol.&#10;&#10;6/7 The coup didn't work, but that was only luck. The organizers are still free, and they're getting ready for Coup II and this one is going to work. They're using our own laws to pre-rig the outcome of the next national election.&#10;&#10;7/7 So to President Biden, who was refreshingly honest and open about Putin (and I don't think it was a gaffe, btw) what are we going to do about the Putinites in America?&#10;&#10;PS: The only punishment for Trump was he lost his TWTR. https://t.co/QDsNjpi4Mz&#10;&#10;PPS: That the Capitol was completely undefended can't have been an accident. I wasn't born yesterday and neither were you. If that had happened in another country would have believed there wasn't help on the inside?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Quigs8816 This is a bit different from Iraq. Putin actually has WMDs and has threatened to use them. Yeah it has to be our policy that he goes. Or else there's a new balance of power between the US and Russia.&#10;&#10;@Quigs8816 We're just waiting to see what happens in Ukraine before we figure out what the new balance is. But we can't ever &quot;do business&quot; with a Russian leader who threatens to use nukes, unless we're willing to make that threat too.&#10;&#10;</description>
