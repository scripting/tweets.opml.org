			<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s remarkable (to me at least) that none of my products make this list. I&amp;#39;d think at least River5 would be on it. Oh well. I guess I&amp;#39;ll have to try harder. 😀 &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/SEyFmr2GPU&quot;&gt;https://t.co/SEyFmr2GPU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Once again, I wish Amazon would make a product that worked like Dropbox where the content was also accessible to apps via the S3 API. Then the web would finally be up to the same jobs PCs and Macs were in the 1980s. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Google Reader was a Lannister product. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/1ettnszhtY&quot;&gt;https://t.co/1ettnszhtY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A better picture of Sergei, blowing up the RSS world because he was bored with news. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/nJ8DAIfA76&quot;&gt;https://t.co/nJ8DAIfA76&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is something people really don&amp;#39;t understand, a story no news org covered. Google Reader was a popular product when Google shut it down. It was an internally-driven decision. The top guys at Google felt they had too many products, and wanted to prove they could shut one down.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It was a very Let Them Eat Cake type decision. Who cares what the Little People want. That&amp;#39;s why we (the Little People) should never trust huge companies with market dominance in any product category, esp not one based on an open technology.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;1/5 I heard yet another piece on NPR this morning wondering why Biden&amp;#39;s approval rating is so low. First question, who has ever shown that this number means anything? Esp at the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2/5 Second, the reason his approval rating is so low is that he&amp;#39;s old and frail. On the other hand, I know he&amp;#39;s in great shape. But when he&amp;#39;s giving a prepared speech, the makeup is bad, or the lighting, but his eyes have the beady look of a very old person. And he is terrible at&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;3/5 reading speeches. The intonation is all wrong. There&amp;#39;s nothing human about it. I imagine they&amp;#39;ve hired coaches to try to improve this, but he hasn&amp;#39;t gotten better. Funny thing is, when he&amp;#39;s doing a press conference, which is very rare, he&amp;#39;s great! His mind is sharp, he&amp;#39;s an&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;4/5 excellent communicator. You quickly forget how old he is. My guess is that his handlers think the famous Biden gaffes are too expensive, so they play it safe with the prepared remarks approach. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s working. It&amp;#39;s the source of &amp;quot;he&amp;#39;s too old.&amp;quot; And ultimately who&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;5/5 cares what NPR thinks anyway. Stop worrying. Let Biden be Biden.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Why isn&amp;#39;t there a Reproductive Rights Pac like the NRA. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One that rates candidates on their support for women.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;One that we can give $ to that they in turn give to candidates that campaign on Reproductive Rights.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Of course people will say it&amp;#39;s Planned Parenthood, but they do more than that. I&amp;#39;m talking about a PAC that&amp;#39;s focused on making abortion rights a major issue in all elections until the Dobbs decision is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;August is the best month. Everyone nice and relaxed. Nothing to do. No major holidays. Swimming. BBQs. Book reading. Hanging around doing nothing. Everyone is somewhere else. Baseball. Warm. Shorts. Hikes. Bikes. Beach.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Just read yet another article about RSS being D**D and wanting to know why, and thinking browsers and big companies should help.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;ol&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;YOU can help by not writing articles like this.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Browsers and big companies were the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feeds should look like feeds, not web pages. Imagine if you lifted the hood on your car and saw a car interior in there. How confusing would that be. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch out for new interesting feeds and spread the news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same for new software for reading feeds. Spread the news.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help devs make easier products.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No more articles with the d-word.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/7J9UM5z2Yh&quot;&gt;https://t.co/7J9UM5z2Yh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;/li&gt;&#10;&lt;/ol&gt;&#10;</description>

			<source:markdown>Just read yet another article about RSS being D**D and wanting to know why, and thinking browsers and big companies should help.&#10;&#10;1. YOU can help by not writing articles like this.&#10;&#10;2. Browsers and big companies were the problem.&#10;&#10;&#10;3. Feeds should look like feeds, not web pages. Imagine if you lifted the hood on your car and saw a car interior in there. How confusing would that be.&#10;&#10;4. Watch out for new interesting feeds and spread the news.&#10;&#10;5. Same for new software for reading feeds. Spread the news.&#10;&#10;6. Help devs make easier products.&#10;&#10;7. No more articles with the d-word.&#10;&#10;8. https://t.co/7J9UM5z2Yh&#10;&#10;</source:markdown>
