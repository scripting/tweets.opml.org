			<description>@AdamSinger you and i think this way because we come from tech.&#10;but in the world of journalism and democrats they don't think that way. they have their places on the ladder and they don't step outside of the roles they've been cast in.&#10;&#10;@AdamSinger it'll be all the more fascinating when you hear how agile the author's mind is when it comes to the constitution.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Things to cancel:&#10;1. Supreme Court.&#10;2. Electoral College.&#10;3. Senate.&#10;4. States.&#10;The we have this: representative government.&#10;We can reinstate the Supreme Court after all the rest is done, with a much larger cast, and term limits.&#10;Think big!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AdamSinger as a friend --&amp;gt; move it to the top and skip to the chapter on abortion. it really is a mind bomb.&#10;&#10;@AdamSinger i've been twisting the arm of the author to post the audio of just that chapter to youtube. we should be thinking big right now. big change is happening. we don't have to have it done to us we can do some of the changing ourselves.&#10;&#10;@AdamSinger the author is a brilliant thinker and orator, but alas not much of a firebrand. we need revolution now. and we can have it. it's at times of great change, even tragic change, that big things are possible.&#10;&#10;@AdamSinger i heard a great talk by the science fiction writer bruce sterling about this. that when you get a divorce or a parent dies, or something else that's huge, that's when you can make big changes. otherwise it's business as usual.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AdamSinger there's a spectrum of possible disobedience.&#10;we failed to really clean things up after the civil war.&#10;we could now also abolish:&#10;1. the electoral college.&#10;2. the senate.&#10;3. states.&#10;that would undo the imbalance in the system and get us representative government.&#10;&#10;@AdamSinger the constitution is like an operating system.&#10;&#10;the one we have was designed for slavery.&#10;&#10;but then a few decades after the bill of rights we changed our mind, and decided not to have slavery.&#10;&#10;it's like going from character based to gui.&#10;&#10;but we never wrote a new OS.&#10;&#10;@AdamSinger that's why we keep snapping back to this mode, where the slave owners are trying to re-assert their dominance.&#10;&#10;that really is what we're doing. i've been reading all about it the last couple of years.&#10;&#10;@AdamSinger adam, you want to have your mind blown? i recommend listening to this audiobook. it's a palate cleanser re the constitution.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/XOsSdtmY2p&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@emilymiller_nyc It was odd that Thomas didn't include Loving v Virginia in his list until you realize he's in an interracial marriage.&#10;https://t.co/bAs4Ys7fYP&#10;&#10;@emilymiller_nyc Clarence and Ginni Thomas. https://t.co/poJIMPKlUl&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wonder what the federalists plan to do when the dems add four more justices to the supreme court. didn't hear that idea discussed on msnbc tonight.&#10;&#10;also no mention of the ninth amendment tonight on msnbc. in it is proof that the supreme court isn't about the constitution. they're playing their own game.&#10;&#10;but the dems are actually right to make it about the election, but instead of telling us to vote, they should be running ads that make the repubs eat this. i hope that's what pelosi was saying.&#10;&#10;after the november election biden should announce he's not running again, and let the dems start the campaign for 2024 then. someone young and strong, and not the typical wimpy democrat. someone who breathes fire and kicks republican ass.&#10;&#10;i leave you tonight with this ad, which until today was just a cautionary tale but now it is reality in the united states of america. spread it around. this is home.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/M4opXIyF7Y&#10;&#10;</description>
