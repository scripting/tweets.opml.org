			<description>Comment to CNN: Yes, right now Biden is leader of the free world, but a couple of years ago our president was on the other team, and not too far down the road, if things don't change radically, we'll be changing teams again. Don't forget that context.&#10;&#10;That's where Putin has fun. He can screw with our political system, but it appears we have no power in the other direction. We can't give him a problem at home.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KenSmith But what does that get you if the social media is twitter, which already has a lists feature. It would be hard to sell that as an improvement, esp not in 2022 when feeds are not leading edge and right now even twitter doesn't support them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@themexican Curious about that last part. Where do Russian state channels heavily influence what people see? Certainly not in YouTube or Instagram?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@gruber @lucas_gonze I don't know what I meant back then, I've transformed a lot in between (as everyone else).&#10;I use Markdown when it's called for as on GitHub.&#10;My https://t.co/FOqCP15WOg files of course are MD.&#10;cont'd&#10;&#10;@gruber @lucas_gonze Where it's a problem is it's being used as an interchange format between outliners and it doesn't have enough power to do that well. People distrust binary formats, as they should. But we're limited in interop because as JG says there's so little standardization or even docs.&#10;&#10;@gruber @lucas_gonze So it's not that the core MD is not well specified, people are going beyond that. It's user-driven which is great, that's my religion, but it shows how that can backfire.&#10;&#10;I'm learning a lot about evolution these days. Why we don't get more and more optimal features.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Shouldn't we be figuring out how to communicate directly to the Russian people, the way Zelensky was trying to last night?&#10;Why don't we have their equivalent of Fox News?&#10;It seems they have access to some of our networks?&#10;Maybe one of the big news orgs could research that?&#10;&#10;Basic question: What kind of media access do Russian people have?&#10;&#10;For example, if you're in Russia can you read this tweet?&#10;&#10;I'm guessing not. But I don't know.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Putin is so clever, but this is just the beginning of his war, when presumably his generals and troops are all gung ho.&#10;Maybe they'll even take Kyiv. And Putin can have a Mission Accomplished moment.&#10;Then what? 😀 https://t.co/CPSaIXMwLJ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Another thought.&#10;The web and Linux has never had the system-level scripting we had on the Mac 25 years ago.&#10;Apple, just like the music industry with Napster, couldn't think of anything to do but crush it.&#10;Didn't fit in with their philosophy.&#10;We'll try it again.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Of course people would pay for music.&#10;Napster did in one year what the music industry on its own would never have done.&#10;I kept saying -- people are talking about music in the supermarket for crying out loud!&#10;We'd pay anything for this. https://t.co/jZBSJRohQO&#10;&#10;</description>
