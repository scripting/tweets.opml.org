			<description>Earlier today before the decision was announced, I explained how the democrats must change. Staying the course will not work. It was a mistake as early as 2016 to let the new repubs ride, but now it's way past time to take the gloves off.&#10;https://t.co/eAp5sCpRzS&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>We should consider ignoring the Supreme Court from now on. Declare the Constitution defunct, and go on from there. One side respecting the Constitution and the other side ignoring it is not a workable situation.&#10;&#10;I am not a legal scholar, but&#10;&#10;1. the 9th amendment says 'the enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'&#10;&#10;So abortion doesn't have to be in the Constitution for it to be a right.&#10;&#10;2. the 2nd amendment begins 'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State..'&#10;&#10;the amendment was meant to quell slave uprisings, and we in theory no longer have slaves, but this part is always ignored by republicans on the court.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Politically, tag every Republican candidate for *anything* with this decision. It's a referendum on freedom. The Repubs, each and every one of them, are on the wrong side of this. Make them defend it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Obama didn't have to accept what the Repubs tried to do to Merrick Garland. He could have waited a decent amount of time for the Senate to advise and consent, assume they consented, and walked Garland, himself (with the Secret Service) over to the Supreme Court to take his seat.&#10;&#10;RBG was sick, and the chances of her dying were too high for her to stay on the court past Obama's tenure.&#10;&#10;Had Garland been seated, and RBG replaced with a moderate, and assuming Trump had been elected and his nominees confirmed, the court would now be 4-3-2* which is a pretty good configuration, much better than the 6-3 disaster we're dealing with now.&#10;&#10;* 4 conservatives, 3 liberals, 2 centrists.&#10;&#10;Now the Democrats have to do something bold and risky in response. No more playing it safe, as is their approach up till now.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>The Democratic Party as it exists now is not prepared to deal with the kind of change that is now happening.&#10;We need to be incredibly organized, and we're not organized at all.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @pilhofer @froomkin Jeff exactly right. No one would trust Google, but we trust Amazon with exactly that service. It's what they do. Manage retail's money and make it possible to live in the mountains (as I do) without having to go to Target or Home Depot.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @pilhofer @froomkin But the NYT would squawk at the WP taking over the economics of news for everyone but the NYT (who would be welcome but who'd be the last to join as Walmart has resisted Amazon).&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@pilhofer @froomkin The opportunity for an Amazon For News is enormous and could solve a big problem -- paying for news without subscribing. Think about all the ways Amazon does that for retailers (I buy everything I can through Amazon for many years, so I'm pretty well schooled in their abilities).&#10;&#10;@pilhofer @froomkin Most important -- they could make our EZ Pass For News. Make it so I can read New Yorker articles and run up a huge monthly bill with absolutely no commitment.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/B6QPHKwqE9&#10;&#10;There's no reason to assume they'd make less money from me, they'd probably make more.&#10;&#10;</description>
