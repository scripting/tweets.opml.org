			<description>Why don't the Democrats usurp Make America Great Again. It's really what it's about.&#10;The New Deal, The Great Society. Roe v Wade.&#10;These are the very specific things Dems did and want to do more of.&#10;Never has the divide been clearer.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU if twitter had the power to ban whoever they wanted, for whatever reason, specified or unspecified, they would never be criticized, would only get good press, and they would have a great business model, selling protection.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU here's a question.&#10;&#10;remember the indiana bakery that wouldn't make a cake for a gay couple...&#10;&#10;what if twitter decided that all gay people were banned?&#10;&#10;or anyone who had been arrested was banned (delegating to the police the right to eliminate critics).&#10;&#10;what power they'd have.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU i wonder, however, with today's supreme court, they'd probably say -- twitter has the right to ban whoever they want for whatever cause.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU jeff, i don't have the answers to any of these questions, btw -- i just mention them because if you think moderation is the answer, you have to deal with all of them.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU personally, i don't think this system is sustainable.&#10;&#10;i bet twitter really boxed in. it looks like facebook is giving up too. given the expectations of journalism, which is very powerful, it may not be possible for a service like twitter to exist much longer.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@SteveBrant btw, no one who can create a half-dozen companies, complex ones, that solve heretofore unsolved hard problems, could be a &quot;disaster&quot; at human stuff. quite the opposite.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU imho they don't have an editorial product. this has been an argument between journalism and tech since the beginning, and nothing has changed as far as i'm concerned, yet journalism acts like they won the argument.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU it's just like when journos thought bloggers were trying to steal their jobs. i'm sure you heard that. it's simply not true.&#10;&#10;tech didn't want the job of moderation, and ultimately it's diseconomic, and we all know that, it can't be where this ends up.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU anyway i think twitter can give us the tools to effectively kick trump off twitter. i think we had pretty good tools when he was on, but people insisted on RTing him, to say how much they hated him.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU and it's not the trumps i worry about it's all the poor schnooks they ban who you've never heard of and suspect maybe they deserved to be banned.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU trump is a bad example. it was rational to ban him in jan 2021. i was relieved when they did it. but what about the regular people.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@workout_fox i doubt if that's the way it started, btw. i think he was sincerely interested in running twitter. but now that it's slipping away from him, i can't imagine he won't compete in some way. i hope he does.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @JoelKatz @mmasnick @ACLU Masnick's analogy is not perfect. AT&amp;amp;T's service was  used for public speaking. For example radio call-in shows. If AT&amp;amp;T cut me off how would I call in?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wouldn't know if the celebs are gone, I was never interested in what they had to tweet, myself.&#10;&#10;I learned something about actors only recently. They totally depend on the writing. If you give them a bad script, even great actors suck.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JoelKatz @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU I didn't say it was exactly like AT&amp;amp;T. I was viewing it as a network, which also is what Twitter is, and at some point being on the network is so important that kicking someone off is something that should require a process that isn't just up to a private company...&#10;&#10;@JoelKatz @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU Limited by 280 characters makes it hard to express an idea with even a small amount of nuance. I wrote it in a way that someone who wanted to understand, and was intelligent, could.&#10;&#10;@JoelKatz @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU The other lawyer who responded was truly obnoxious. You didn't make it personal, which I appreciate.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AriCohn @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU Let me explain. It's a tweet, with a 280 character limit. Which means what seems &quot;staggeringly incoherent&quot; to you might just be an idea you don't understand.&#10;&#10;@AriCohn @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU We don't know each other, but I'm not stupid, as my friends will (hopefully) tell you, I have strange ideas sometimes, which often turn out to be true. Also disagreeing with someone also isn't a license to be rude.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@biesnecker @TechPRGuy There's more to it than that. I've been reading about slavery all last year and into this year, and it's just like right now. The same people were in charge after the war as before.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What are the odds that Musk actually acquires Twitter?&#10;&#10;My bet is it's virtually zero.&#10;&#10;Why? The difficulties of Twitter have become more apparent, and at the same time, the difficulties of the companies he already controls have gotten bigger with the collapse of the tech stock market.&#10;&#10;Owning Twitter is a hobby he can't afford now.&#10;&#10;PS: I own a small amount of $TWTR.&#10;&#10;</description>
