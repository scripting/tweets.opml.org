			<description>&lt;p&gt;1/4 People think so linear about the #Knicks. There are quite a few players out there with the potential of Donovan Mitchell to lead a team to dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;2/4 Think of what the Knicks have to offer a potential trader. The Knicks bench is filled with potential like few others are. We&amp;#39;ve got a stockpile of draft picks. And the Knicks and the Garden and the talent are starting to get interesting to players. Like the way they want to&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;3/4 go to Duke or Kentucky. The Knicks are the un-Nets. The Knicks are building, not trying to buy a post-season powerhouse. ðŸ˜€&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;4/4 So sit tight, this is not the end of the dream of what those kids on the bench could become. They can become lots of things, not just Donovan Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@JoeTrippi You could say the same thing of the Democratic president. It really is all our responsibility to protect democracy. This is the problem everywhere in our country, the world. People are only aware of their own interest, not our shared interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@JoeTrippi You see it in tech when investors want to reap the reward of other people&amp;#39;s work on open systems, and never want to make any contributions of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@JoeTrippi BTW, I think the journalists are mostly on board with the idea that journalism has to fight on the side of freedom. It&amp;#39;s the owners that are forcing them to change back.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A friend who was an early blogger sent me a link to a story about how blogging came about and no mention was made of how blogging actually came about. He thought I should give them hell.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the way it goes. All we are is dust in the wind. The journey is the reward. Live in the moment. Yadda yadda. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tTHoo1vpqb&quot;&gt;https://t.co/tTHoo1vpqb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;We should all be fired up to vote Democratic thanks to the Dobbs decision and all the other rights the Supreme Court is poised to remove from all of us. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;This is not just about women&amp;#39;s rights, not even close.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;When Biden first used the &amp;quot;Maga Republican&amp;quot; term I was skeptical, but I&amp;#39;ve been hearing reporters and pundits using the term, so it&amp;#39;s caught. It&amp;#39;s a way for McConnell to say hey not all Repubs are fascists.
