			<description>BTW, my plan is to hook RSS up to any protocol people come up with.&#10;And when I say RSS, I mean all flavors including RDF and Atom.&#10;I don't just have advice for other people, sometimes I give myself advice too.&#10;I think it's time to love RSS again. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Musk or Not, Twitter CEO Needs To Go. (The best piece yet on the Twitter situation.) https://t.co/JXXO5BT1re&#10;&#10;I just did a brain dump after reading this.&#10;&#10;Key point -- Twitter has been going nowhere for its whole life, just drifting, aimlessly. That's reality.&#10;&#10;The companies Musk leads do not drift. They create amazing products that change things.&#10;&#10;The way we need Twitter to change.&#10;&#10;It's not just a town square. It's where we communicate as a civilization. The other services are fine for what they do. But if we're ever going to work together we cannot give up on doing it on Twitter. It's where we do that. It's flaws are our flaws.&#10;&#10;We need to transition our minds before we can transition to clean energy so earth will sustain human life. I know this sounds weird, but if that's going to happen it's going to happen here.&#10;&#10;I was an Apple dev when Steve Jobs came back.&#10;&#10;He made big changes at Apple. People didn't like it, journalists said it was suicidal when he killed the clones that they forced Apple to create.&#10;&#10;And after that he fixed the Mac, simplified the product line, iPod, iPhone, etc.&#10;&#10;BTW, tangentially -- some of the things he did really sucked and might've helped Apple be even more dominant, it certainly would have let the web develop more on the Mac, and thus change would have come sooner.&#10;&#10;In 1997 we were just starting to blog. That was the year RSS first came out. Our paths would cross again with podcasting. How much easier this would have been if we could have stuck to one platform. Whatever all water under the bridge.&#10;&#10;Musk coming into Twitter will definitely shake things up much like Jobs coming to Apple in 1997 did. But as Om says, things aren't going very well over here in TwitterLand. Breaking down some barriers would be great. And giving up on things that didn't work also would be great.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Tell someone they did something good, or they look nice, or they're a great friend. Or give them something nice to eat.&#10;I just realized it's so rare that we do this. Everyone's looking for a nice word of praise or reassurance.&#10;We treat our pets better than our human friends.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Carnage4Life When I was an entrepreneur thatâ€™s how I did it. I would say I want their advice, but I really just wanted the money. I didnâ€™t feel bad about it because it was such a precarious lifestyle, and in the end I did my job, earned them good multiples.&#10;&#10;@Carnage4Life Later when I became an angel I was surprised that the entrepreneurs I invested in did exactly the same. ðŸ˜³&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Self-moderation is going to be a huge deal.&#10;Maybe to make something workable you have to start something nÃ©w, not in a half assed way.&#10;How about a Twitter-like webservice at AWS.&#10;Let a thousand Twitters bloom.&#10;Interop baked in from the beginning.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dbfarber @TechmemeChatter @mmasnick Hi Dan, I think thatâ€™s wrong. I own a Tesla and the human factors are everything. The car is driving for me, if I donâ€™t control it, I would never let it drive.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>An idea for @elonmusk. It's possible you can do everything you want by building on the Twitter API.&#10;&#10;Regardless, if you manage to own Twitter, you should reserve some serious resources to invest in developer products. It's a completely untapped thing. Unbelievable how much value there is locked up in an internet-scale notification system with a user-friendly interface.&#10;&#10;API + UI + scale.&#10;&#10;BTW, come to think of it, why doesn't @bluesky start working at the API level. Why focus on reinventing the communication layer. What twitter has is incredible. It works, and the people who own the platform aren't shitheads.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>free speech is great, but there's no requirement that anyone listen.&#10;he challenge of our online systems is to learn what we want to know and find it for us.&#10;my tesla doesn't drive for me, it learns what i want it to do and tries to do it.&#10;&#10;</description>
