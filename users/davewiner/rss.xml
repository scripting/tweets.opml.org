			<description>@JRubinBlogger that's the susan collins defense. oops i was fooled again. but it obviously isn't true of her, how could she be so stupid to be fooled so many times, and honestly i don't think it's true of journalism either.&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger the rational view says that news is controlled by oligarchs, and they don't like democracy, don't trust it, and don't see any reason they should stick their necks out for it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I didn't coin the term web 2.0, but i didn't object to it either, because what we were doing was realizing the vision of the web from the guy who invented it, who wanted it to be two-way, that people wouldn't just read stuff on the web, they would also write stuff.&#10;&#10;that was my first impulse when i understood what the web was, that and &quot;how do I create something for this?&quot; luckily that was very easy, amazingly easy. once i saw that i started telling everyone that this was the future.&#10;&#10;so i'm open to the idea of tech being used for new things. so now there's this thing they call &quot;web3&quot; which better be pretty great because it says it's better than the web, right? it ought to have something to do with the web too, or why call it web3?&#10;&#10;so i've been listening and listening and i still have no clue what it is, and how i would develop the equivalent of a website for it or a web app.&#10;&#10;all i here is a bunch of proclamations about how it's the future mostly by people who don't create anything.&#10;&#10;so my opinion so far is it's a way for vc's to make their money without any technology at all, no need to employ programmers, or support users, just create new currency and get people to give them money for it.&#10;&#10;how that is supposed to be the web, well i don't think it does have anything to do with the web, other than it's a name people can argue over and that gives their idea heat, and drives interest, etc.&#10;&#10;it's just a more efficient way for vc's to make money, in other words. unless you want to show me a developer plan, for how to create a website or an app. then i'll have something to evaluate. but i honestly don't think such a thing exists.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jochmann Yeah I was sure someone would say that. No one has to say demeaning things about a whole gender, itâ€™s a choice, itâ€™s mean and it hurts people. Itâ€™s proof that this isnâ€™t about fixing things, itâ€™s about power, the power to hurt people.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Wow the Washington Post sucks. https://t.co/QQnC9Mr6Uq&#10;&#10;Women say nasty stuff about men on Twitter regularly, with impunity, and if you object, they make it personal. So I donâ€™t buy that Dave Weigel was suspended for sexism (though his joke was sexist) rather because he made a sexist joke about women.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@codexeditor @phonetonote I'm not so sure. The deep think part is relatively easy compared to the getting-it-to-work part or the getting-people-to-listen part. ;-)&#10;&#10;@codexeditor @phonetonote The basic idea is that there are outlines everywhere inside the computer. So why write a million shitty outliners, when you could have one really good one with all the right stuff hanging off it. Then what would happen.&#10;&#10;@codexeditor @phonetonote The getting-people-to-listen part is basically impossible. It'll wait until people want it. Enough people are fed up with all the bullshit Apple throws at their OSes.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Seriously, what OSes need is a total top to bottom rethink. What purpose do they serve. Start there.&#10;I have a feeling when theyâ€™re done theyâ€™ll find a lot of objects with relationships to other objects.&#10;&#10;So make a great organizing editor and hang tools off it.&#10;&#10;Otherwise known as an outliner. ðŸ™€&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@donpark -- i was reviewing my blog from August 2002, to see how we got to RSS 2.0, and came across this post of yours, which was pivotal.&#10;https://t.co/7S96EUoJUX&#10;After reading that I saw that I wasn't the only one who felt the mess needed to be cleaned up.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday I read the archives of my blog for August and September 2002. It's a pretty good archive of a project that started off as RSS 0.94 and led, a month later, to RSS 2.0. It's all about humans and interop, very little actual tech. :-)&#10;https://t.co/6ZS6SdjcvS&#10;&#10;@judell, then a columnist at InfoWorld, said including namespaces in RSS 2.0 was an olive branch. All perspectives are valid, but imho it was not that -- it was a commitment made early in the process. When the format was frozen, it would be extensible.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/coGWNUfdcY&#10;&#10;</description>
