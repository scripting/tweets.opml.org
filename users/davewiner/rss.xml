			<description>My guess is that every billionaire is going to try to compete with Musk, maybe some will join together. If you know how to write a TWTR get busy.&#10;&#10;AWS should have, long ago, written a faceless TWTR clone, and let a million flowers bloom. As with many other things, I beat the drum ceaselessly for this, as far as I know they never heard me.&#10;&#10;That's why it was interesting to see @jeffbezos poke @elonmusk in the eye this morning. That's exactly the kind of thing a competitor would say, and the fact that he said it so publicly, on TWTR, says he's going to do it. He wants to reserve the space in our minds.&#10;&#10;Anyway another thought, making a federated twitter will be hard. No one knows how to do it. But I bet a lot of people know how to clone twitter. That's the way this will go.&#10;&#10;And we should make sure all these clones can peer with each other.&#10;&#10;I'm available to help with this.&#10;&#10;BTW, here's the Bezos tweet.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/CRdB3Eqny8&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>In January 2017, as Trump was taking office, I warned that a Republican could buy Twitter. Here's a short thread, explaining. https://t.co/d1z4p9KBCe&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>In January 2017, as Trump was taking office, I warned that a Republican could buy Twitter. That it had enormous value that wasn't reflected on its balance sheet. It was only worth $12 billion then.&#10;&#10;I contacted an investment banker, a friend I've known for 30+ years, a really creative guy, and I think he thought I was bonkers (he didn't say it as such).&#10;&#10;Then I wrote a blog post to get it on the record.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/P7QKFCq1Qa&#10;&#10;PS: It's kind of embarrassing I said that Zuck would run for president, that was before his rep blew up.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Jason For such a young guy he has a very fear-driven way of looking at things. As if he or anyone has any idea where we're going.&#10;Remember we used to talk about jumping out of a plane with no parachute and building the parachute on the way down. That's basically my comfort level. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote very nice. i think i get it -- they're going through your follows on twitter, then going to their websites, looking for &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;s to feeds and then adding them to the OPML file that it outputs.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rswilbourn @elonmusk I agree. To understand you really have to have some experience in tech. I'm hoping that 90% of what he does is simply straighten things out so they can start adding features, and supporting new interfaces. Twitter should be at the center of something amazing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote It is possible to make the API 10x easier to build on.&#10;Facebook's API is the prototype for that.&#10;I implemented the Twitter API, took a month, I expected it to take a month for FB, instead it took a day.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It's not fair the way Knicks fans are dissing Nets fans, but I guess it's ok because as we all know there aren't any Nets fans.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I *love* this NYT headline.&#10;Basically, you grow teams, there's no such thing as a superteam. When you try to conjure up one as the Nets keep doing you end up with suckage as was on display this season at Barclay's. https://t.co/ntkheK8syt&#10;&#10;I have enjoyed this year's Knicks, with all those sweet rookies and sophomores, and have thoroughly enjoyed trashing the pathetic &quot;superteam&quot; that plays in Brooklyn. This is and always will be the Knicks' city.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/tWnj4LHC8t&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KnicksMemes At that moment knicks fans all said to themselves ‘he’s dead to me” and poor KD never bothered to learn that 99% of NBA fans in NYC love the Knicks, and the other 1% root for teams other than the Nets. There are a handful of holdovers mostly from NJ who say “KD whodat?”&#10;&#10;</description>
