			<description>Our politicians are such artificial people the president can’t express legit rage at what the Repubs are doing to our country. He’s reminiscing about bipartisanship, when he should be putting them down, destroying them, no compromise.&#10;&#10;He dreams of the old south, the plantation and mammy and her long underwear. He imagines himself as Rhett butler, and Moscow Mitch as Miss Scarlet.&#10;&#10;He finally is fed up and says to Mitch...&#10;&#10;https://t.co/a2v00n6V9I&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@pilhofer This is fascinating. Normally I'd agree with the sign on the right, but I live in a place where you don't know about the neighbor. The family on the left *is* making an important statement.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/4 I fear for Ukraine. What happens when we decide it's over even when the war is still raging, as we have done with Covid, not caring how many people's lives will be ruined, or ended.&#10;&#10;2/4 I expect it'll be the same with Roe v Wade, until we really get woke and see the big picture. We need societal mechanisms to stay focused on what matters, and not lose the focus in meaningful ways, until the problem is solved or the threat is over.&#10;&#10;3/4 Lots of other things fall into that bucket btw: climate change, regulating guns in the US, black lives matter, LGBTQ rights. We only focus briefly, leaving us vulnerable to dishonest power-hungry people who are more patient.&#10;&#10;4/4 Social networks can help, but only ones that are carefully crafted to stay focused on the goal they are assigned to. Twitter and Facebook et al were invented and bootstrapped in chaos. I understand this process as well as anyone. There are other ways to do it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Happy Mother's Day.&#10;Richard Nixon used to say his mother was a saint.&#10;I always thought that was weird, because I could tell she was not a saint, because you have to be pretty fucked up to raise a Nixon.&#10;Nixon hated himself, you could tell.&#10;Where do you think he learned that?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/6 I read that former VP Pence was upset that current VP Harris said she was in favor of abortion rights. He must be feeling pretty good, cause he's a religious zealot and the religious zealots are getting their way, forcing the rest of us to obey the rules of his religion, even&#10;&#10;2/6 though the Constitution says clearly he doesn't have that right. It's in the first amendment if you're looking for it..&#10;&#10;3/6 Then I wondered, since he cares so much about the unborn, how much would he be willing to suffer for each child born to a mother who doesn't want the child. There's a lot of pain involved in being an incubator for Mike Pence's religion. Would he be willing to suffer the pain?&#10;&#10;4/6 It costs a lot of money too. Would he be willing to pay for the care of all the unborn he insists should be carried to term?&#10;&#10;5/6 In other words, it's easy for him to have a strong opinion about this, he doesn't have to suffer, or risk his life, or pay money he doesn't have.&#10;&#10;6/6 If he's such a moral person perhaps he'll put some skin into this crusade of his.&#10;&#10;</description>
