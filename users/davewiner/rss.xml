			<description>If voting is the big thing, then we ought to practice.&#10;Local marches to our polling places, before Election Day. A few times so we don't forget how to get there.&#10;BBQ, music, and of course voter registration.&#10;Make voting a social event. A joyous occasion.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>twitter thinks one of my domains is a &quot;malware url&quot; -- but it's not -- until now it wasn't being used for anything other than a parked home page.&#10;i'm not finding anything online about this error...&#10;obviously it's in some database somewhere somehow.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I think this is what you'll regret at 80.&#10;That you aren't 20.&#10;&#10;And btw it's because sex is great at 20.&#10;&#10;So if you're 20 you should do a lot of that.&#10;&#10;At least it'll make you smile when you're 80 (I imagine).&#10;&#10;And btw secretly I think the reason the Supreme Court passed that crazy abortion ruling is that they resent people who had good sex when they were younger.&#10;&#10;Hey people of my age were all of us horribly repressed because we were raised by people who were raised by crazy people.&#10;&#10;Of course today's young folk were raised by crazy people too, so I've never bought the idea that they're so much more evolved. ðŸ˜€&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ElieNYC The same country absorbed over 1 million deaths from Covid, many of which were preventable, maybe all of them.&#10;&#10;@ElieNYC The problem imho is that we're organized to be stupid, politically, no one has invested in making us organized intelligently, even those of us who are curious, educated, who want to do good. Our only outlet is to give money and vote.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DBaird13 The thing that really gives me pride is that it can serve as an example to young developers that their work can make a difference, and it isn't all about making huge piles of money.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I hear someone talk about podcasting in such a mainstream way I feel a sense of accomplishment.&#10;Podcasting made a difference. It worked. ;-) https://t.co/SrN7Q34cJE&#10;&#10;Evan Williams and the team at Blogger should feel that pride too, Twitter made a big difference. Yes he got a few billion more dollars than I did, but I never cared about money beyond enough to buy my own freedom, which I got before the web became a thing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is outrageous. It's fine if Justice Kavanaugh feels so empowered to force women to carry pregnancy to term, or even give up their lives, but he should get ready for lots of &quot;politics,&quot; and forget out a nice dinner out with the family. That part of his life is over. https://t.co/8oMKmrVmEZ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/2 I didn't watch the conference with @semaforben, but I sure heard a lot about it -- and it seems they're missing the big niche that none of the pubs old or new seem interested in. It's the idea I gave the @martinn123 in 2001, find all the sources, people with expertise and&#10;&#10;2/2 give them a home. We already have too many legit journalism outlets competing to be number one, how about something truly different, instead of all the news that's fit to print, or democracy dies in darkness, make your mission to save the world.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>The other day I replied to a tweet by a famous  columnist and even though the trolls couldn't reply, a  number of them did QT it with the usual crap. Then I remembered I had turned the quality filter off. I turned it on and they went away. As if they never existed.&#10;&#10;</description>
