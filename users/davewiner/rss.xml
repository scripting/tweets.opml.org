			<title>The default place-of-record for writers</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;I would love to see a university-based open source project to create a Medium-like service, run as a non-profit, written and maintained by students, with the help of teachers of course, funded by foundations and contributors.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The mistake we keep making is relying VCs to create a simple default place-of-record for writing on the internet. Medium has a great user interface, but because they had to find an elusive business model, it kept changing what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s possible to create a default place-of-record for writing with a business model attached.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;The university that took this project on would have a long-term source of project funding, and their students would learn more than computer science, they&amp;#39;d learn how to create and support a real world system that means something.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And if I recall correctly college students are often searching for that kind of experience, to do meaningful work with their talents.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@johnrobb thanks john -- i&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s been stagnant not frozen. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;no reason it couldn&amp;#39;t move, it&amp;#39;s just that people didn&amp;#39;t know how to do it or want to do the work needed. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i do think you&amp;#39;ll like where it&amp;#39;s going. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@kevin2kelly @stevenbjohnson I like to take problems on a walk. There’s something I’m not going to solve when I’m sitting at my computer screen, just need to relax a bit let my mind wander and after while my options are clear and I can see which way to go.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger I wrote in one of my recent pieces that it would be great if a foundation came up with a grant for a nonprofit to provide hosting of text documents like medium and substack. just as a backup for people who are happy with substack.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger the choice shouldn&amp;#39;t be between having to deal with the pain of hosting or giving up on having your writing survive me. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;i find that having a backup of stuff i wrote 20 years ago is actually incredibly important, so i can piece together why i gave up on RSS, for example.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger to go off on a tangent, i loved the Get Back movie on Disney about the Beatles. everyone thought the Let It Be sessions were a disaster, but they weren&amp;#39;t. even paul mccartney thought they were. but he was great!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;people&amp;#39;s memories are very undependable.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger i am starting a reboot of RSS right now, and all i remembered was the shitty stuff. but as the lights just begin to start coming back on, i also (now) remember the really wonderful people i worked with on this stuff. i just remember the assholes!! so weird.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger but it&amp;#39;s all there in my blog notes from 2002. but if i didn&amp;#39;t have them i&amp;#39;d have totally the wrong idea about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger you might do something that matters to you in 20 years, and since you write so well, what a terrible loss it would be if you couldnt access it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger you should have it both ways. there&amp;#39;s no reason to give on writing for the record.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AdamSinger Hmmm. Just because you had a bad experience hosting your own site doesn&amp;#39;t mean it is impossible for anyone but Substack to keep hosting you. You&amp;#39;re really smart so I know you know that. I&amp;#39;m smart too so come -- let&amp;#39;s be respectful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AJCGlobal @biannagolodryga @CobbSchools Until recently a few southern states had the stars and bars in their state flags. Black people look at that symbol the same way we look at Nazi signage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Now there&amp;#39;s a way to say an RSS item was written in Markdown, and to include the Markdown source text. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which raises the obvious question... 😀&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which Markdown?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pvkvE8a7CG&quot;&gt;https://t.co/pvkvE8a7CG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
