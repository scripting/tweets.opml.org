			<description>Next time you're going to tell someone they're tone deaf or something like that pause for a moment and ask yourself how you know. Sometimes applying truth to power means asking yourself questions you don't want to answer.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>The reason the United States is as fucked up as it is is that we were born with slavery.&#10;The Constitution was designed so that American whites could keep making wealth with its slaves, along with the pretense of being about freedom.&#10;We're living with that right now.&#10;&#10;And the chief justice who says he worries so much as the court seeming legit is also the person who scuttled the Voting Rights Act and gave us unlimited corporate money in our elections, so he should cut the shit about legit, he's just another servant of the super rich.&#10;&#10;Our economic prowess belongs to a very few people and they won't share it with the people. That's the top line. They don't give a shit about the unborn, we all know that, it's a way to get stupid white people to vote for their candidates.&#10;&#10;As I understand the history they did that with slavery too. The convinced poor southern whites that they were superior to slaves, and they kept voting to maintain that sense of being privileged, even though they got nothing, zip, they were poor white trash.&#10;&#10;Someone should book a big auditorium, maybe at Cooper Union, to have @elieNYC speak about the Constitution. It really is all about slavery. We're still fighting about that.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@lifesafeast A country with a Constitution that was designed so that slavers could keep their slaves.&#10;And btw, Europeans profited enormously from that system as much as Americans, so they should get down off their high horses. Their ancestors gave us this curse we have to overcome.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>One way Twitter can grow is to become a coral reef.&#10;And to do that we need the ability to attach data to tweets.&#10;@jack understands this. I had lunch with him, in 2007 or 2008, and he said this was the plan. I loved it. Can't wait.&#10;&#10;I recognized the idea from the architecture of the Mac, and we used the same idea in Frontier.&#10;&#10;In the Mac it's called a refcon. A handle that's up to the application.&#10;&#10;We used the same name in Frontier out of respect to the concept we were copying.&#10;&#10;&quot;Only steal from the best.&quot;&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@mims Twitter grew out of the blogging world and the people of blogs and the norms of blogging moved here. That's why Twitter is what it is.&#10;Facebook started with students, then moved to families. That's why it is what it is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AdamSinger @mims Yes. Trolls follow crowds online. To say a place has trolls simply means enough people congregate there to attract trolls.&#10;&#10;</description>
