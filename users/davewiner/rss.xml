			<description>About 20 years ago, in March 2002, we did a deal to bring the NY Times to Radio Userland users via RSS. This is a pivotal moment for RSS, which was still mainly a bloggers thing. From that point on it was for journalism too.  https://t.co/2IO5x186o2&#10;&#10;A screen shot of my 2002 feed reader including nytimes items. https://t.co/yNTxsNm9NQ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I told you they were going to do this.&#10;If they manage to kill Zelenskyy, they will say he's a Ukranian hero, and they were fighting to protect him.&#10;That's how Putin will put this war behind him.&#10;At least 40 percent of Americans will believe him you know including Tucker. https://t.co/tUOFLCatPM&#10;&#10;Everyone who says Putin fucked himself is full of shit. Getting out of bullshit with lies is what he excels at. Why do you think DJ Trump admires him so much? Because of his virtue? Integrity? No -- Trump loves Putin's bullshit.&#10;&#10;More here.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/YbnuY4C20a&#10;&#10;And if you want to see a dark comedy about this stuff I can recommend two.&#10;&#10;1. Death of Stalin.&#10;&#10;2. Wag the Dog.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>The basic question to ask anyone who wants to provide a writing service for you is this:&#10;Do I have to use your writing tool?&#10;If the answer is no -- go right ahead, they're not locking you in.&#10;If the answer is yes -- find a service that doesn't lock you in.&#10;&#10;But be ready to pay money for the service that doesn't lock you in. No one is willing to host your stuff for free. If you aren't paying them in cash, you're paying them some other way.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@wjmaggos @hamishmckenzie why does everyone think i have to have an opinion. yes reading is wonderful. everyone should do it. and thinking is good too. go for a walk, meet a friend for lunch. these things healthy happy people do.&#10;hope that helps. ;-)&#10;&#10;@wjmaggos @hamishmckenzie one more thing -&#10;&#10;i didn't like that google reader could only handle a subset of rss. that coupled with their dominance really screwed with the evolution of writing on the web.&#10;&#10;i guess i did have something to say after all. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis I'm probably not the best person to do that.&#10;I'd ask @brentsimmons, who has created a popular iPhone feed reader. He'd know the issues better than I.&#10;I use RSS in desktop apps only. I probably should use a mobile app but there are lots of things I should do that I don't. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/3 One of the biggest problems/design mistakes in JavaScript is that programming on the server and the client are so different. The built-in verbs are the same, date verbs, string verbs, but the data models are completely different.&#10;&#10;2/3 And the modules are different. How did that happen. Why couldn't &quot;require&quot; work in the client? If I had been in charge, there would have been a rule that if we're implementing something in the client that has already been done in the server, we must&#10;&#10;3/3 do it the same way, unless it really is impossible, and it has to be very impossible. And vice versa of course.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jen_mcfadden yes. who knows which idea is whose, but that company is set up to suck the life out of everything it comes in contact with. if she was just taking orders, the least she could do is quit. but she's still there.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Sheryl Sandberg on Russia-Ukraine: Women-led countries wouldn't go to war. (Impossible to know. And probably not true.) https://t.co/74nEk1wgRU&#10;&#10;BTW there have been pairs of women leaders who didn't start wars, but most male leaders don't start wars either. Look at how long it has been since Europe had a  war.&#10;&#10;It's an dishonest statement though, like most gender boosting slogans. We create each other. I had a mother, so did every man. Where do you think we learned how to be who we are? Basically, if women are so great, why don't they raise better men?&#10;&#10;There's even a song about that, written by Merle Haggard, but I like the Grateful Dead version better.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/P0uXl2bSzN&#10;&#10;But there's another Dead song that says that uncles have a lot of influence too. I concur, my uncle Ken was a big influence on me.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/LiIWV3nNuo&#10;&#10;Here's the last part of that song. His uncle taught him well.&#10;&#10;Love my uncle, God rest his soul&#10;Taught me good, Lord, taught me all I know&#10;Taught me so well, that I grabbed that gold&#10;I left his dead ass there by the side of the road, yeah&#10;&#10;</description>
