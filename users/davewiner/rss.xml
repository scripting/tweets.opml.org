			<description>Putin wants respect as a superpower.&#10;He wants us to think about him as daunting and menacing.&#10;He didn't know, after the election of 2016, he had us exactly where he wanted us.&#10;But his military apparently was his weakness.&#10;He should have kept that hidden.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/7 Here's an idea of how to cut fuel consumption for electricity.&#10;&#10;2/7 My electric bill has been going up, dramatically. Not sure how much this is due to rising energy cost, or my purchase of a Tesla electric car last year, or something else. I use electricity for lots of things. More all the time.&#10;&#10;3/7 What's the difference in cost between keeping the thermostat at 65 vs 60? Maybe it's insignificant, or maybe it's very significant. I have no idea.&#10;&#10;4/7 I have no tools to tell me what my electric consumption is graphed over time. If I did, I could for example, unplug the car and see how much the consumption goes down. Or turn down the thermostat to 60 and see what happens.&#10;&#10;5/7 Who knows what my car is doing when I'm not watching? It has a mind of its own. Not like old cars that did nothing when they're turned off, my Tesla is always waking up and doing stuff. I bet that uses energy.&#10;&#10;6/7 Maybe one of my devices is somehow malfunctioning and using a lot of energy and I could reduce consumption by replacing it, or leave it turned off unless I'm using it.&#10;&#10;7/7 We're all flying blind. Let's create the tools to optimize energy use. I bet it would save a lot of money and be a good way to cut energy consumption.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just caught up on round the clock coverage of Ukraine and it’s gotten into a short loop about the implications of no fly zones and the character of Putin. People being interviewed seem exhausted.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalism is self-governing. Responsible to no one but itself. Journalism is its own journalism, and not surprisingly that means no journalism. Imagine any other industry or organization that could make sure it never gets bad press. That is the problem with journalism.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@erinbiba @TaylorLorenz @maggieNYT @MarkMazzettiNYT @jdawsey1 @GregJaffe @JaxAlemany Reporters in general only listen to other reporters.&#10;And NYT reporters in general (again) are even worse, they only respect other NYT reporters.&#10;Our experience is irrelevant.&#10;Taylor will object, she's wonderful and the exception to all the rules.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Now is a time for news sources that might be cut off to start using RSS seriously because that would allow others to mirror their content, and make it possible to get it back online with just a DNS change.&#10;&#10;People thought we were being too idealistic when it was said that a benefit of syndication is that it helps route around censorship. Now in 2022, that's a very real thing. Such an inexpensive insurance policy to help make sure the news gets out.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@workout_fox that makes sense for the 60s and 70s, in Germany, but the distinction today is not significant and it suggests to readers that there's something new an innovative. Maybe these are the &quot;nice&quot; Nazis. The point is they don't deserve any qualifiers, a Nazi is just a Nazi.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>The term &quot;neo-Nazis&quot; should be deprecated.&#10;Nazis are Nazis, nothing neo about them.&#10;&#10;Listening to an NPR story where they say neo-Nazi over and over again. I'd like to ask the reporter what's the difference.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KyivPost Maybe we can help by mirroring your content in a variety of places. When one gets hacked, just point your DNS to one of the other places.&#10;&#10;@KyivPost Unless of course they're hacking your DNS.&#10;&#10;@KyivPost Just saying it would have been trivial to help if you had an RSS feed, which it appears you don't (from the HTML of your home page).&#10;&#10;</description>
