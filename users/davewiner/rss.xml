			<description>1/3 NPR this morning did the ultimate unforgivable &quot;both sides&quot; horse-race bs -- they labeled people who support Roe v Wade as extremists and wondered if such extremism will cause the Democrats to lose in November. Journalism will let the center go where ever the Repubs want to&#10;&#10;2/3 put it. Now Roe is extreme, last month it was the settled law, according to all but one of the Supreme Court justices (publicly, privately they were ready to destroy it). The problem isn't Repubs, they're just taking what we're letting them have. The problem is journalism and&#10;&#10;3/3 the Democratic Party, but even more broadly the problem is we don't put a stop to this and tell the Dems clearly that they have to get real, or we won't re-elect them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was taught that America is a great country.&#10;1. By the education system, which was wrong.&#10;2. By my family -- who had good cause to feel America is great, because they took us in during the war, if they hadn't my family would have died.&#10;But I'm beginning to lose the faith.&#10;&#10;A country isn't great because it says it's great.&#10;&#10;A great country does what the Bill of Rights says, but for every citizen, and not for fictitious citizens like corporations.&#10;&#10;And the people who make the rules have to be great too, net-net. Not everyone is great, of course, but the checks and balances apply and the system is set up so that it lives up to the rules in the Bill of Rights.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>NPR this morning did the ultimate unforgivable &quot;both sides&quot; horse-race-manship -- they labeled people who support Roe v Wade as extremists and wondered if such extremism will cause the Democrats to lose in November. The reporter and interviewer was a young black woman.&#10;&#10;We have to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court in January 2023. I want to hear Democratic candidates say that, specifically. Codifying Roe is not enough. I simply won't support any candidate that doesn't support reforming the court.&#10;&#10;So imho -- wanting to get back to Roe is far from extreme. It isn't nearly extreme enough.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bloatedlesbian i don't think it's all that expensive, you have them put it up for a minute, once, and take a picture of it and put it on your instagram page. or maybe it isn't even real, maybe it's just photoshopped? i don't know who he is btw.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can't believe all the crazy bs swirling around the Knicks right now. Here's the deal. We have a really interesting team, we're going to get really emotionally involved with them next season. We're going to *love* rooting for them, win or lose. So stop kvetching and relax. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/2 I want Biden to step back after the election and let the Democrats have a great primary campaign where we really discuss, as a country, what our options are going forward. Not limited to things considered too daring, like expanding the court.&#10;&#10;2/2 It's clear Biden will not do what we need. But that's okay, his greatest contribution would be to create a stage for the next generation of leaders to work things out, along with Bernie Sanders and others.&#10;&#10;</description>
