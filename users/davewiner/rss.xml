			<description>Why did Cassidy Hutchinson's testimony come out today?&#10;1. They had it on tape, so they could have done it earlier.&#10;2. Was she was threatened?&#10;3. To force others to testify?&#10;4. Something we don't know about?&#10;&#10;More questions. This happened 17 months ago. What was she doing all this time? What changed that made her want to speak now. Or maybe she spoke to the committee a long time ago? Why hold on to testimony like this? Why didn't the press get this story first?&#10;&#10;From what she says it sounds like at least a dozen people were inside on this, could have told basically the same story she told all these 17 months. That's a lot of potential sources the journalists could have gotten the story from.&#10;&#10;On the other hand how much of it was really new?&#10;&#10;We like her, of course. She's a well-spoken, humble, young attractive woman.&#10;&#10;But what of this did we not already know?&#10;&#10;The business with The Beast? That was cool.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Cassidy Hutchinson: Former Mark Meadows aide will testify before January 6 committee on Tuesday, sources say. https://t.co/lNtL5qdJda&#10;&#10;Maybe we're going to get first hand testimony on what Trump was doing while the Capitol was under attack by his supporters.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@HC_Richardson @bijan First thank you for the response, I wasn't really expecting it. A regular reader and podcast listener.&#10;I've been reading about slavery for the last two years, including your book, and my sense is that we're still dealing with unfinished business from the civil war.&#10;cont'd&#10;&#10;@HC_Richardson @bijan Sorry for the &quot;cont'd.&quot; I'm just going to let it stand there.&#10;&#10;Thanks again for responding. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@HC_Richardson @bijan I was wondering if Lincoln hadn't been assassinated, do you think he would have done a better job of getting support of slavery out of the Constitution? Have there been debates about this in historian circles?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm beginning to think the con here is so huge -- biden is just another version of susan collins. poor befuddle grandpa just doesn't get it. but he's an actor too. and kamala harris, she's falling apart on cnn. i couldn't believe how she's losing it. presumably she prepped?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>codifying roe v wade would have fixed it 20 years ago. now it's in a different world. we need to stop this in its tracks, add four liberal justices to the court.&#10;honestly we have to get people like klobuchar out of the way. they're still thinking this just a little insurrection. https://t.co/xfX9KX8WzK&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@amyklobuchar i think it's more like it's an alternate reality, like living in a science fiction movie, like man in the high castle, where germany and japan won ww ii.&#10;and it isn't just women who feel that. let's make this as big as it is, not make it smaller.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>My blogging ethos came from the Whole Earth Catalog. They moved from technical howto-type stuff to whatever was on @stewartbrand's mind. If the ideas come from the same mind, and the pub is a product of that person's mind, it's perfect.&#10;&#10;I remember reading it at my uncle's house in florida, totally off the grid little geodesic he made himself. i loved the Whole Earth book because it seemed like my uncle. an engineer and hippie. he was another big influence in my eclectic, jumping where my mind wanted to go.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wonder if Pelosi were president now we might have a better chance to turn this whole thing around.&#10;I dream of a court that's 4-3-2 (conservative, liberal, moderate) to make sense out of the mess the new court is making.&#10;We could make a lot of lemonade here imho.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@nakedjen actually yes. i've come to realize that too. for all of JL's disdain for commercialism, he thought of himself as a Dylan, he was a master at commercialism.&#10;&#10;@nakedjen and JL was definitely the alpha. watching Get Back you could see that in their relationship.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Kyrie Irving and the Nets sounds like a bad Silicon Valley novel. https://t.co/vdxexCRueh&#10;&#10;BTW, the best Silicon Valley novel ever imho was Microserfs. After you read the book, it programs you to think you're *in* the book. Amazing how complete the virtuality was.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/gtP7qbu6v9&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @JamesFallows @JoeNBC @ElieNYC I bet @leolaporte would let you use his rig for this.&#10;I think it's a great idea.&#10;I've actually been emailing with JF about Mystal, they know each other. Coincidence? ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Paul McCartney sings I've Got a Feeling at Glastonbury. Near the end they bring up John Lennon on the screen singing his part of the duo while McC sings his. Very emotional moment. Thanks to John Naughton for the link.  https://t.co/xZ9wEPfDOb&#10;&#10;</description>
