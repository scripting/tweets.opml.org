			<description>Guns are scary, and they divide the country and have for a long time. And there are absolutely correct answers, things we could do that would lower the death and incapacity rates.&#10;But compare that to our dealing with Covid...&#10;&#10;How could a country that has digested over a million Covid deaths in the last two years, and even now hasn't done anything to slow the virus, really stop anything when we can't do what it takes to stop the virus.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A Washington Post reporter RTd a not horribly sexist joke. His colleague posted a complaint, publicly, and the roof caves in on him. He deleted the tweet and apologized. He gets suspended. She couldâ€™ve sent a DM or posted something on their slack.&#10;So who did the worse thing?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If you want to write a Twitter app, this is all you need to know. It's a lot. It could be made much simpler. If it were made simpler, Twitter would create a new kind of web. We've never had a scriptable web-scale resource like Twitter.&#10;https://t.co/ORXKAR5nEg&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>&quot;I guess all the military-style equipment Republicans constantly funnel to the police really is just meant to shoot gas canisters at unarmed protesters outside a Target, not to subdue a lone gunman systematically executing children and teachers.&quot; https://t.co/KAtq3U4XWn&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JRubinBlogger that's the susan collins defense. oops i was fooled again. but it obviously isn't true of her, how could she be so stupid to be fooled so many times, and honestly i don't think it's true of journalism either.&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger the rational view says that news is controlled by oligarchs, and they don't like democracy, don't trust it, and don't see any reason they should stick their necks out for it.&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger If you think it's far-fetched, it's not. In fact it's how our country was founded. Only landed white men had votes. Because the founders, who were of course landed white men, and many of whom owned slaves, did not believe in the fundamental value of everyone getting a vote.&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger Why would it be any different today for the people who own the news distribution system? How else would you explain the content that flows through CNN, MSNBC (who are supposed to be the real journalism orgs).&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger Unremarkably, they see the Republican point of view as reasonable and they echo it.&#10;&#10;And even the most outspoken pundits won't say this, even if they know it -- because you don't bite the hand that feeds you.&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger I learned this a long time ago, when a big news org was in the process of blowing up, and I knew a columnist there, and asked him why he wasn't writing about the blowup? Even better, why weren't any reporters, anywhere writing about it. Blank stare. A meaningful blank stare.&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger The meaning? I can't talk about this. Even though everything on his resume said that he would talk about it. That's the problem with journalism, there's a gorilla and dinosaur in the middle of the whole thing that no one can write about.&#10;&#10;@JRubinBlogger And that my friends is where the True Power hides. ðŸ˜€&#10;&#10;They did make a movie about him once.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/dAW6JC0Gj6&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I didn't coin the term web 2.0, but i didn't object to it either, because what we were doing was realizing the vision of the web from the guy who invented it, who wanted it to be two-way, that people wouldn't just read stuff on the web, they would also write stuff.&#10;&#10;that was my first impulse when i understood what the web was, that and &quot;how do I create something for this?&quot; luckily that was very easy, amazingly easy. once i saw that i started telling everyone that this was the future.&#10;&#10;so i'm open to the idea of tech being used for new things. so now there's this thing they call &quot;web3&quot; which better be pretty great because it says it's better than the web, right? it ought to have something to do with the web too, or why call it web3?&#10;&#10;so i've been listening and listening and i still have no clue what it is, and how i would develop the equivalent of a website for it or a web app.&#10;&#10;all i here is a bunch of proclamations about how it's the future mostly by people who don't create anything.&#10;&#10;so my opinion so far is it's a way for vc's to make their money without any technology at all, no need to employ programmers, or support users, just create new currency and get people to give them money for it.&#10;&#10;how that is supposed to be the web, well i don't think it does have anything to do with the web, other than it's a name people can argue over and that gives their idea heat, and drives interest, etc.&#10;&#10;it's just a more efficient way for vc's to make money, in other words. unless you want to show me a developer plan, for how to create a website or an app. then i'll have something to evaluate. but i honestly don't think such a thing exists.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jochmann Yeah I was sure someone would say that. No one has to say demeaning things about a whole gender, itâ€™s a choice, itâ€™s mean and it hurts people. Itâ€™s proof that this isnâ€™t about fixing things, itâ€™s about power, the power to hurt people.&#10;&#10;</description>
