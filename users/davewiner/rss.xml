			<description>If the Dems had a passion for humanity they’d ratify 20 new Supreme Court justices this year, and pass a law that  limits the term of a justice to ten years.&#10;I am not a lawyer but I read a book written by one and this is what the author recommends, and he makes a compelling case&#10;&#10;The book…&#10;&#10;https://t.co/XOsSdtmY2p&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis jeff -- a couple of comments..&#10;1. a former colleague said that in tech we don't stand on the shoulders of giants, we stand on their toes. ;-)&#10;2. in all seriousness, this is a real problem because our work is not easily digestible, it's not like going to a movie or listening...&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis to an album, so a lot of us literally don't know what the people who came before us did.&#10;&#10;I did it myself when I was coming out of grad school. I could have gone to work in the minicomputer business, but their stack was to me incomprehensible...&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis ...what was comprehensible to me was the Apple II, so I got one and started developing. A few years later I was in silicon valley, had a company and was making a small fortune.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis but over the many years since, i've seen us throw out progress with both hands, over and over -- in important ways the Mac OS of the 1980s was more capable than the Web OS we us in the 2020s.&#10;&#10;and now with this &quot;web3&quot; bullshit, they want to do it again!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>One  of  these  decades  the tech industry is going to grow the fuck up and stop insisting on being the boy wonder and respect what has been accomplished before they showed up. Then we won’t have to constantly be retooling and ripping up the pavement and starting over.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don’t buy this idea that Russia can’t lose in Ukraine, after all the United States lost in both Iraq and Afghanistan. And let’s not forget Vietnam. A big adult country doesn’t have to win every battle it chooses to fight.  https://t.co/8rjluwpBS3&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jack In everything I read about bluesky there was no plan to use what was built with rss.&#10;I saw activitypub, xmpp, but no rss.&#10;jack, as you might imagine, my work builds on rss so we’ll be competing.&#10;so unnecessary. Just like a bigco. Come down off your pedestal, be a mensch.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A user said he’d be more inclined to use Drummer if i planned for it to continue to work after I stop working.&#10;First, yes I did plan the best I could. All your files are in an open format which can be read by most outliners.&#10;&#10;You can easily and quickly download all your files with a single command and you should do it frequently.&#10;&#10;If you want it to keep running, help out next time there are new features, get involved in testing. Anyone can do it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@FrancescoD_Ales @pierce I had a funny experience.&#10;I thought yesterday's show was the season finale, all the way through the ending.&#10;I screamed &quot;you bastards!&quot; -- out loud.&#10;Then looked and found out there's one more episode to go.&#10;Whew.&#10;&#10;@FrancescoD_Ales @pierce BTW -- I saw that you were looking for podcasts, something I suggest that like Severance, will bend your mind, is not a podcast but an audiobook.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/XOsSdtmY2p&#10;&#10;A real perspective-changer. Also he's got an addictive style of speaking.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I sat down at the breakfast table to solve the Wordle puzzle for the day. I sad to solve it in less than a minute. Now what to do? Guess I have to get to work! ;-)&#10;&#10;BTW -- I find that only my subconscious mind can solve the puzzle, to actually see the solution. I can analytically arrange for the clues to be available to my subconsciousl but the word pops into my mind in an instant. I have no awareness of what the process is.&#10;&#10;Usually I'm sure when I have the answer. Today I wasn't even sure the correct word was actually a word! What a nice surprise when all five letters came out green and then did their little dance. 😍&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KenSmith heh this is a question i've been asking for years. in the early days of blogging i tried to get an online news group to pop up to cover Linux. it didn't happen. as long as i was pushing it myself it had momentum, when i stepped back, nothing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TaylorLorenz Taylor, I was for a while the center of the blogging world, and all the abuse we were gathering was aimed at me.&#10;People would figure out who I was dating, and then go after them. Same for the people who worked with me.&#10;&#10;@TaylorLorenz Eventually I deliberately cut down on my fame. To take the focus off me. A lifestyle choice.&#10;&#10;I don't know that there's any other way out of the problem. Writing about it publicly only makes it worse I found. Very little sympathy out there for the person at or near the top.&#10;&#10;@TaylorLorenz Some of the abuse came from people who worked for the big tech companies who were threatened by the work we were doing, btw. Hard to say if the companies put them up to it, but I'm sure it didn't hurt their careers.&#10;&#10;</description>
