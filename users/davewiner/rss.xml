			<description>There's so much power to be taken all around you. But if you're waiting for someone to give it to you, packaged up a gift box with a ribbon, that's never going to happen.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>BTW -- I write threads with a tool I wrote called https://t.co/KAVhNd06pG. You can use it too.&#10;One advantage is that if someday you switch to another twitter, you can keep using TC to write for it.&#10;Decoupling writing from publishing gives power to the writer. Think about that.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/7 What I like about Elon Musk is he took over for Steve Jobs as the audacious tech lover who did wtf he wanted and told people he didn't like to fuck off.&#10;&#10;2/7 Jobs actually said the words, not if sure Musk does.&#10;&#10;3/7 Both made audacious products that capture the imagination. Very few people do that. And their products were also outrageously successful.&#10;&#10;4/7 And even with all that success, they both were willing to put it all on the line, over and over, because they had an idea they wanted to see through.&#10;&#10;5/7 Making software for Jobs is another matter. He tended to blow up his developers' products, something that platform vendors get to do.&#10;&#10;6/7 When I realized I couldn't be part of his platform, I bought some $AAPL stock to wipe away the tears, and as a result I can buy nice toys like my new Tesla. ðŸ’¥&#10;&#10;7/7 As Tesla stock goes down after the Twitter deal was announced, I realize I should probably be buying some.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@mterenzio Or you could have multiple algorithms each in its own tabs. Apple has things like that. I've been thinking about it in my new aggregator. SQL queries defining rivers of news.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm addicted to Twitter, but I could live without it, if I had something better.&#10;What I want is to be connected to smart people who want to work together to make cool things and solve important problems.&#10;That, emphatically, is *not* what Twitter is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@mterenzio @jeffjarvis you mean it wasn't just elites who were crushed by #metoo? if so, yes. and no they weren't all guilty. we should have a process, justice shouldn't be dispensed by mobs.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It would be kind of interesting to add a feature to Twitter where it automatically adds a bit to the beginning of every tweet. Something like:&#10;1. You're right...&#10;2. I agree...&#10;3. Good point...&#10;I try to do that myself, manually.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is incorrect because they have the ability to filter out messages from people they donâ€™t follow. The elites are as isolated and self-contained as ever. https://t.co/YLLlkGl0H5&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>My guess is that every billionaire is going to try to compete with Musk, maybe some will join together. If you know how to write a TWTR get busy.&#10;&#10;AWS should have, long ago, written a faceless TWTR clone, and let a million flowers bloom. As with many other things, I beat the drum ceaselessly for this, as far as I know they never heard me.&#10;&#10;That's why it was interesting to see @jeffbezos poke @elonmusk in the eye this morning. That's exactly the kind of thing a competitor would say, and the fact that he said it so publicly, on TWTR, says he's going to do it. He wants to reserve the space in our minds.&#10;&#10;Anyway another thought, making a federated twitter will be hard. No one knows how to do it. But I bet a lot of people know how to clone twitter. That's the way this will go.&#10;&#10;And we should make sure all these clones can peer with each other.&#10;&#10;I'm available to help with this.&#10;&#10;BTW, here's the Bezos tweet.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/CRdB3Eqny8&#10;&#10;</description>
