			<description>When I finish a programming session, the top note in my outline is always how I'm going to start the next session. Otherwise I get the &quot;staring at a blank sheet of paper&quot; thing. My judgement on the next thing is much better at the end than at the beginning of a session.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@berzerkeley it's a big thing. we think other people are responsible because we were infants once, and our basic ideas were formed then, and at that time our happiness was in fact in the hands of someone else.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>When we got to the bottom of why people hated us for hosting their blogs for free it was this. They thought that if they did a blog, people would listen to them. They thought we were promising that (we weren't we had no illusions about that).&#10;&#10;Another thing to learn from. When you ship a new product, think carefully about what features you want to implement first, so early users get an idea where the product is going. What its &quot;vector&quot; is long-term, because as we know, software is a process, not a thing.&#10;&#10;The idea that software is a process was the big idea in &quot;We Make Shitty Software&quot; in September 1995.&#10;&#10;Here's a screen shot of the relevant portion.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/HHyRsTXwRz https://t.co/ZaeBwQaaGA&#10;&#10;I got a lot of shit from devs who said they don't make shitty software, but in fact, they do. All devs do. Those that don't know they do don't know to set up a process that accounts for the shittiness of their software.&#10;&#10;A corollary -- Some of the shittiest software is made by devs who think their software isn't shitty.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AFP Wouldn't it be cool if we had a channel that could speak directly to the Russian people to tell them that many of us in the US are of Russian descent, we celebrate the culture, but we can't have you guys invading sovereign countries, and that's our main problem with Russia.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Putin must not have known how much power he had. Ukraine is small potatoes. He was the czar of one half of the political system of the US. It was a real possibility his party would control the whole govt again in 2024. A lot of times people don't know how successful they've been.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/6 Yesterday I wrote a piece that asked a philosophical question. This is how it went. The government can't search you without probable cause, that's in the Constitution. But if you invite someone into your house to visit and they go through your private stuff, that's also&#10;&#10;2/6 wrong, even though the Constitution says nothing about it.&#10;&#10;3/6 In the same way, you have &quot;free speech,&quot; even when it's your employer, school, news org or your family or friends trying to control your speech. The Constitution doesn't prohibit them from doing it, so you don't need to make that much-belabored point.&#10;&#10;4/6 Being intolerant of other people's opinions is still, as far as I'm concerned, and many other Americans, of all persuasions, wrong. In America you are free to speak, and it's not just the government that's about, no matter what XKCD says.&#10;&#10;5/6 If you punish people for expressing their opinions, you are wrong.&#10;&#10;6/6 Even so someone will post that stupid XKCD cartoon about showing you the door. That just proves you're an asshole, although you are certainly entitled to your opinion and I will not try to have you fired. Have a nice day. 😀&#10;&#10;</description>
