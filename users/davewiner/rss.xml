			<description>I'm swapping my Tesla Model 3 for a Model Y later this week. I needed the extra room, getting in and out of the sporty Model 3 was too hard on my back.&#10;https://t.co/7cotComN9T&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@tingilinde @gassee @elonmusk Me too. They could set a precedent for other media, offer the users a way to opt out of the surveillance features. I want to be a customer, not a product.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jakeludington It's missing the big feature. See if you can figure out what it is.&#10;&#10;@jakeludington Here's a hint.&#10;&#10;I already have software I use every day that can do all five exactly the way I want it. Yet I would still be willing to pay $10 a month to Twitter to do the same thing.&#10;&#10;Am I out of my mind? No. Well maybe but not because I want this feature.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jakeludington @elonmusk @Medium The problem with that question is it assumes Medium is offering the same thing I'm asking for and they are not.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Okay here's a Twitter package I'd pay for and so would a lot of other people.&#10;Call it Twitter Pro.&#10;Features:&#10;1. Posts can have titles.&#10;2. Simple styling.&#10;3. Links.&#10;4. Podcasts.&#10;5. Unlimited length.&#10;$10 per month.&#10;I'd pay. Without a moment's hesitation.&#10;cc: @elonmusk.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A thread runs through most of the coverage of the new Twitter run by Musk -- that is:&#10;1. Musk is stupid.&#10;Of course he's not stupid. No one that rises to a unique position of wealth, power or fame is.&#10;If you came to that conclusion, throw it out, because it's wrong.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalists are creatively dysfunctional part 11,287.&#10;Twitter is a huge powerful platform with lots of unexplored applications. Of course he can double revenue through subscriptions. You have to imagine other applications for the platform.&#10;https://t.co/GTGD1XfJOy&#10;&#10;For a comp, consider how much revenue there is for the iOS platform. And how much revenue would you have thought was possible in 2007?&#10;&#10;Twitter has never been run as a business. That's why there's so much upside.&#10;&#10;Journalists think they know everything. That's the other big bug.&#10;&#10;Another comp. People pay Tesla, another Musk company, $10K to subscribe to their full self driving functionality. I don't know how they got me to do it, I'm one of those people. ;-)&#10;&#10;Twitter, if you were using it in the early years, had a huge problem in getting the system to work at scale. So they focused on that above all else for years. Then they got it to scale, it works really well now. And then they had other scaling problems to deal with (trolls).&#10;&#10;They've never had the time to take a fresh look and focus on turning it into a business and a real developer platform. It may not seem fair, but a new CEO with lots of experience squeezing big money out of tech products might be able to do this.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Our politicians are such artificial people the president can’t express legit rage at what the Repubs are doing to our country. He’s reminiscing about bipartisanship, when he should be putting them down, destroying them, no compromise.&#10;&#10;He dreams of the old south, the plantation and mammy and her long underwear. He imagines himself as Rhett butler, and Moscow Mitch as Miss Scarlet.&#10;&#10;He finally is fed up and says to Mitch...&#10;&#10;https://t.co/a2v00n6V9I&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/4 I fear for Ukraine. What happens when we decide it's over even when the war is still raging, as we have done with Covid, not caring how many people's lives will be ruined, or ended.&#10;&#10;2/4 I expect it'll be the same with Roe v Wade, until we really get woke and see the big picture. We need societal mechanisms to stay focused on what matters, and not lose the focus in meaningful ways, until the problem is solved or the threat is over.&#10;&#10;3/4 Lots of other things fall into that bucket btw: climate change, regulating guns in the US, black lives matter, LGBTQ rights. We only focus briefly, leaving us vulnerable to dishonest power-hungry people who are more patient.&#10;&#10;4/4 Social networks can help, but only ones that are carefully crafted to stay focused on the goal they are assigned to. Twitter and Facebook et al were invented and bootstrapped in chaos. I understand this process as well as anyone. There are other ways to do it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Happy Mother's Day.&#10;Richard Nixon used to say his mother was a saint.&#10;I always thought that was weird, because I could tell she was not a saint, because you have to be pretty fucked up to raise a Nixon.&#10;Nixon hated himself, you could tell.&#10;Where do you think he learned that?&#10;&#10;</description>
