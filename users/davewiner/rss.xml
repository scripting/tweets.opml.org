			<description>@nalband @rroudt @thunknotes Happy to help.&#10;We ultimately developed a format for sharing outlines called OPML. It's quite popular.&#10;https://t.co/UneKXbLqA8&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It'd be interesting to see the results of a poll: 1. Do you wear a mask to protect against transmission of Covid? 2. Are you in favor of repealing Roe v Wade to force people who are pregnant to go through months of painful, risky and expensive medical procedures?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rroudt @thunknotes There is another possibility, focused apps and interop.&#10;&#10;@rroudt @thunknotes An example. In the early 90s, my company had a programmable outliner called Frontier. It had a rich scripting language and object database. Easy to develop in. People liked the outliner.&#10;&#10;cont'd&#10;&#10;@rroudt @thunknotes At the time there were two leading page layout and prepress products, Pagemaker and Quark XPress. It turns out there was a strong connection between page layout, scripting and outlining. There was lots you could in the intersection.&#10;&#10;@rroudt @thunknotes Instead of PageMaker and Quark doing their own outliner, scripting system, object databases, that were incompatible, instead they created APIs and we wrote glue for them in Frontier, so people had their choice. And other people made outliners and scripting systems.&#10;&#10;@rroudt @thunknotes Since these products were often used inside organizations, this meant companies could build their own workflows to take more of the work out of the layout process, and writers could use whatever tools they liked.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Robert_A_Wolfe @elonmusk That's correct. I want Twitter to peer with blogging platforms. BTW, I wrote the first blogging software, so you can assume I know what the features are. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm swapping my Tesla Model 3 for a Model Y later this week. I needed the extra room, getting in and out of the sporty Model 3 was too hard on my back.&#10;https://t.co/7cotComN9T&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@tingilinde @gassee @elonmusk Me too. They could set a precedent for other media, offer the users a way to opt out of the surveillance features. I want to be a customer, not a product.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jakeludington It's missing the big feature. See if you can figure out what it is.&#10;&#10;@jakeludington Here's a hint.&#10;&#10;I already have software I use every day that can do all five exactly the way I want it. Yet I would still be willing to pay $10 a month to Twitter to do the same thing.&#10;&#10;Am I out of my mind? No. Well maybe but not because I want this feature.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jakeludington @elonmusk @Medium The problem with that question is it assumes Medium is offering the same thing I'm asking for and they are not.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Okay here's a Twitter package I'd pay for and so would a lot of other people.&#10;Call it Twitter Pro.&#10;Features:&#10;1. Posts can have titles.&#10;2. Simple styling.&#10;3. Links.&#10;4. Podcasts.&#10;5. Unlimited length.&#10;$10 per month.&#10;I'd pay. Without a moment's hesitation.&#10;cc: @elonmusk.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A thread runs through most of the coverage of the new Twitter run by Musk -- that is:&#10;1. Musk is stupid.&#10;Of course he's not stupid. No one that rises to a unique position of wealth, power or fame is.&#10;If you came to that conclusion, throw it out, because it's wrong.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Journalists are creatively dysfunctional part 11,287.&#10;Twitter is a huge powerful platform with lots of unexplored applications. Of course he can double revenue through subscriptions. You have to imagine other applications for the platform.&#10;https://t.co/GTGD1XfJOy&#10;&#10;For a comp, consider how much revenue there is for the iOS platform. And how much revenue would you have thought was possible in 2007?&#10;&#10;Twitter has never been run as a business. That's why there's so much upside.&#10;&#10;Journalists think they know everything. That's the other big bug.&#10;&#10;Another comp. People pay Tesla, another Musk company, $10K to subscribe to their full self driving functionality. I don't know how they got me to do it, I'm one of those people. ;-)&#10;&#10;Twitter, if you were using it in the early years, had a huge problem in getting the system to work at scale. So they focused on that above all else for years. Then they got it to scale, it works really well now. And then they had other scaling problems to deal with (trolls).&#10;&#10;They've never had the time to take a fresh look and focus on turning it into a business and a real developer platform. It may not seem fair, but a new CEO with lots of experience squeezing big money out of tech products might be able to do this.&#10;&#10;</description>
