			<description>@futuroviudo I've built up my whole world with packages.&#10;Retooling is a huge waste of time. It'd probably be simpler for me to take a couple of months and just implement require in the browser. I can't imagine it's all that hard. I bet someone has done it. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>In JavaScript: Why can't we have the require verb work in browser-based apps as it does in Node. It would take a URL as a param. So much simpler if I could use exactly the same modules in both places.&#10;https://t.co/ZstmLfjMLr&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Today I learned that the former &quot;Washington Football Team&quot; is now called the Washington Commanders. Awful stupid name. They should have changed their name to the Washington Americans. Would have closed the loop.  https://t.co/QxVc4JD1FK&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>While the choice is the woman's, it's her body, the reproductive rights of men are involved too.&#10;I speak from experience there. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Outliners will have compatible apps that render them.&#10;Right now the renderers are specific to the outliner.&#10;It's as if you could only use one word processor with a printer.&#10;As we get more interop between outliners, based on OPML, it will be possible to write renderers that..&#10;&#10;...work with all of them.&#10;&#10;You could even mix outlines from different writing tools in a single presentation.&#10;&#10;All those wonderful outline displayers should be open so we can use any writing tool we like.&#10;&#10;Things are beginning to come together.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@amyklobuchar What's in the way? Some of your colleagues don't want to do it. Are they in the pockets of pharma? Getting kickbacks? I bet there are some Dems doing it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@berzerkeley That's like forgetting the actual date when you quit smoking. For me it'll be 20 years on June 14. Not likely I'll ever forget that date. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Ending Roe v Wade will end the United States.&#10;The world is built around reproductive freedom, led by the United States. A country that repeals such a fundamental right no longer is, imho, the United States.&#10;Where we go from there I don't know.&#10;&#10;One thing's for sure -- we can't let the Supreme Court actually do it.&#10;&#10;I didn't think Obama would let them steal the seat of Merrick Garland.&#10;&#10;Then I didn't think Obama would let Trump take office.&#10;&#10;Suspend the Supreme Court now. Stop them from releasing this decision.&#10;&#10;Let's talk about Merrick Garland.&#10;&#10;The Senate's role is to &quot;advise and consent&quot; not to impede. When it became clear they would not even hold hearings on Garland, interpret that as approval. Tell Mr Garland to report for work. Secret Service escorts him to his office.&#10;&#10;And yes, I said this is what Obama should've done at the time. But Obama wasn't going to do anything remotely like that. The best he could do was give Putin the evil eye. https://t.co/qNUdS84oTt&#10;&#10;I try to think back to a president would have seated Garland even though he hadn't been approved by the Senate.&#10;&#10;Eisenhower would have done it for sure. And JFK, Johnson, Nixon, Reagan after that, hmm, not so sure.&#10;&#10;What's wrong with the wimp/idiots we elect as president.&#10;&#10;People would've been talking about that, instead of Hillary's Fucking Emails.&#10;&#10;So how do I know Eisenhower would've done it.&#10;&#10;Remember Little Rock?&#10;&#10;That was a moment to be PROUD of America.&#10;&#10;We told the segregationists to fuck off.&#10;&#10;Which btw led to desegregation all over the country. https://t.co/9vjO53epaY&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Message at this year's Davos.&#10;You didn't understand the web and it made mega billions.&#10;So here's a new web, called &quot;Web3&quot; -- you don't understand it, of course (frankly neither do we) but this time you must invest so *you* make the billions!&#10;They will love it.&#10;&#10;</description>
