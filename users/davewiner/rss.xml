			<description>@Jason For such a young guy he has a very fear-driven way of looking at things. As if he or anyone has any idea where we're going.&#10;Remember we used to talk about jumping out of a plane with no parachute and building the parachute on the way down. That's basically my comfort level. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote very nice. i think i get it -- they're going through your follows on twitter, then going to their websites, looking for &amp;lt;link&amp;gt;s to feeds and then adding them to the OPML file that it outputs.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rswilbourn @elonmusk I agree. To understand you really have to have some experience in tech. I'm hoping that 90% of what he does is simply straighten things out so they can start adding features, and supporting new interfaces. Twitter should be at the center of something amazing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote It is possible to make the API 10x easier to build on.&#10;Facebook's API is the prototype for that.&#10;I implemented the Twitter API, took a month, I expected it to take a month for FB, instead it took a day.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It's not fair the way Knicks fans are dissing Nets fans, but I guess it's ok because as we all know there aren't any Nets fans.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I *love* this NYT headline.&#10;Basically, you grow teams, there's no such thing as a superteam. When you try to conjure up one as the Nets keep doing you end up with suckage as was on display this season at Barclay's. https://t.co/ntkheK8syt&#10;&#10;I have enjoyed this year's Knicks, with all those sweet rookies and sophomores, and have thoroughly enjoyed trashing the pathetic &quot;superteam&quot; that plays in Brooklyn. This is and always will be the Knicks' city.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/tWnj4LHC8t&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KnicksMemes At that moment knicks fans all said to themselves ‘he’s dead to me” and poor KD never bothered to learn that 99% of NBA fans in NYC love the Knicks, and the other 1% root for teams other than the Nets. There are a handful of holdovers mostly from NJ who say “KD whodat?”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@om It’s because there’s tremendous value here that does not show up on a balance sheet. He was smart enough to see it, and gutsy enough to buy it, and had the means to do it.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/4 Twitter inherited the blogosphere, in a sense, and the chaos of the company kind of hid the fact that it was owned, all that we put into it, we owned none of it. It could all be sold. Now it’s glaring.&#10;&#10;2/4 Although Twitter was never a living thing, it feels like something died, in an instant, unexpected, shock, the end. When Jerry Garcia died, also suddenly, I wrote:&#10;&#10;3/4 “Like the big tree that fell last March, the death of a huge human being like Jerry Garcia frees up a huge amount of space. Once there was a tree, now there are seedlings. After the sadness, there will be huge creativity.“&#10;&#10;4/4 That’s my wish. With this passing, a big patch of blue sky opens. Let’s create something beautiful.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>2/7 KD came to town and behaved like an ass to NYC basketball fans. 99 percent of us are Knicks fans. The rest are a mix of other teams, yeah probably a few Nets fans in there, holdovers from the NJ days or when they were in the ABA out on the island.&#10;&#10;3/7 We know the Knicks suck. But we don't need to hear that from someone playing for the Nets, who barely have a presence in the mind of NYC basketball fans, who obviously has no respect for us. We know who the Knicks are but have no idea who the &quot;Nets&quot; are.&#10;&#10;4/7 We're still waiting for them to do something that we might care about. Can you imagine -- they thought we wanted to root for Paul Pierce! Come on. You traded all your draft picks for Paul Pierce. Sad.&#10;&#10;5/7 Forget about cross-town rivalries. This is the Knicks' town. You want us to care about the Nets. Okay not saying no, but for now you have to start listening.&#10;&#10;6/7 NYC has pride. You've all abused that pride.&#10;&#10;7/7 After tonight's game, when the Nets are hopefully eliminated for this season, it's time to take a step back and decide if you really want to be here, and then if the answer is yes, find out what it is you want to be part of.&#10;&#10;</description>
