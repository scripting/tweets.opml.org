			<description>I was taught that America is a great country.&#10;1. By the education system, which was wrong.&#10;2. By my family -- who had good cause to feel America is great, because they took us in during the war, if they hadn't my family would have died.&#10;But I'm beginning to lose the faith.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>NPR this morning did the ultimate unforgivable &quot;both sides&quot; horse-race-manship -- they labeled people who support Roe v Wade as extremists and wondered if such extremism will cause the Democrats to lose in November. The reporter and interviewer was a young black woman.&#10;&#10;We have to increase the number of justices on the Supreme Court in January 2023. I want to hear Democratic candidates say that, specifically. Codifying Roe is not enough. I simply won't support any candidate that doesn't support reforming the court.&#10;&#10;So imho -- wanting to get back to Roe is far from extreme. It isn't nearly extreme enough.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bloatedlesbian i don't think it's all that expensive, you have them put it up for a minute, once, and take a picture of it and put it on your instagram page. or maybe it isn't even real, maybe it's just photoshopped? i don't know who he is btw.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can't believe all the crazy bs swirling around the Knicks right now. Here's the deal. We have a really interesting team, we're going to get really emotionally involved with them next season. We're going to *love* rooting for them, win or lose. So stop kvetching and relax. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was looking through some archives and came across this picture of Bill Gates and Steve Jobs probably taken in the 80s or early 90s.&#10;A lot of time has passed. https://t.co/TwGOTtf0Vw&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/2 I want Biden to step back after the election and let the Democrats have a great primary campaign where we really discuss, as a country, what our options are going forward. Not limited to things considered too daring, like expanding the court.&#10;&#10;2/2 It's clear Biden will not do what we need. But that's okay, his greatest contribution would be to create a stage for the next generation of leaders to work things out, along with Bernie Sanders and others.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@brentashley Brent -- what a lovely description of Frontier! ;-)&#10;I'm afraid the sun has more or less set on it now.&#10;It's still there and I use it, but most people have moved on.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @danalacey @ElieNYC That is what’s on the way to happening. Substack led the first exodus. They must be paying our mentor big $$ to incentivize him to stay at the Nation.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @danalacey @ElieNYC I have a contrarian point of view. I think if one of these pubs decided to make it pay-as-you-go it would be so popular with readers that it would make the others want to be part of something like this. If I had the means I would buy one of the pubs just to do this.&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @danalacey @ElieNYC By the way it’s very much like what substack is doing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@danalacey @jeffjarvis @ElieNYC I hate the term micropayments because it implies that there’s very little money in it. The technology should apply across all publications like an EZ-pass for news. Just because it didn’t work once doesn’t mean it doesn’t work now.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @ElieNYC Maybe for some pubs, like the NYT and WP, unbundling would result in lost revenue.&#10;But the rest, like The Nation, need a way for readers to get hooked. I can’t imagine the current approach is working for them.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Okay, the Knicks should stand pat, tell the Jazz to fuck off. I like our team. So many wonderful young players. Then do a big deal mud season or next summer. https://t.co/wdnnjmltmh&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis Why can’t they put up an interface that lets us pay per article read. Why should I have to pay for a subscription to The Nation just to read @ElieNYC? I can go to a Mets game without buying a season ticket. I can take the 7 train to Flushing without paying for a monthly pass.&#10;&#10;</description>
