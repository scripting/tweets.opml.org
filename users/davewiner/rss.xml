			<description>I wouldn't know if the celebs are gone, I was never interested in what they had to tweet, myself.&#10;&#10;I learned something about actors only recently. They totally depend on the writing. If you give them a bad script, even great actors suck.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JoelKatz @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU I didn't say it was exactly like AT&amp;amp;T. I was viewing it as a network, which also is what Twitter is, and at some point being on the network is so important that kicking someone off is something that should require a process that isn't just up to a private company...&#10;&#10;@JoelKatz @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU Limited by 280 characters makes it hard to express an idea with even a small amount of nuance. I wrote it in a way that someone who wanted to understand, and was intelligent, could.&#10;&#10;@JoelKatz @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU The other lawyer who responded was truly obnoxious. You didn't make it personal, which I appreciate.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AriCohn @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU Let me explain. It's a tweet, with a 280 character limit. Which means what seems &quot;staggeringly incoherent&quot; to you might just be an idea you don't understand.&#10;&#10;@AriCohn @jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU We don't know each other, but I'm not stupid, as my friends will (hopefully) tell you, I have strange ideas sometimes, which often turn out to be true. Also disagreeing with someone also isn't a license to be rude.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@biesnecker @TechPRGuy There's more to it than that. I've been reading about slavery all last year and into this year, and it's just like right now. The same people were in charge after the war as before.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What are the odds that Musk actually acquires Twitter?&#10;&#10;My bet is it's virtually zero.&#10;&#10;Why? The difficulties of Twitter have become more apparent, and at the same time, the difficulties of the companies he already controls have gotten bigger with the collapse of the tech stock market.&#10;&#10;Owning Twitter is a hobby he can't afford now.&#10;&#10;PS: I own a small amount of $TWTR.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/2 What if Twitter Corp split itself in two. One half operated the network. The servers, the api, the client software. It would sell its services, for a fee, to anyone.&#10;&#10;2/2 The other half would own the network you and I use. It would charge for ads, maintain order, testify in congress, negotiate with the EU, and pay the first company to run its servers.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jayrosen_nyu You're absolutely right, I do lament that, all the time.&#10;But he isn't CEO yet. Other than speak about it, I don't see that he's done anything.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @mmasnick @ACLU Twitter is like AT&amp;amp;T was in the 70s.&#10;Imagine trying to use the telephone in 1978 but you couldn't access AT&amp;amp;T's network.&#10;That's the role of Twitter in 2022.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jayrosen_nyu Do you mind if I strongly push back?&#10;No one can be an expert in everything. When you run a business, even a small one as I did many years ago, you find you understand a smaller and smaller percentage of what your company does.&#10;&#10;@jayrosen_nyu What matters is how well you prioritize and how well you learn and delegate. So you're seeing, imho, *not* a future CEO failing, rather you're seeing him meet the challenge.&#10;&#10;@jayrosen_nyu You and I talked about this many years ago, I just re-read a bit about it, the one on NBB's. What makes someone an NBB not only makes them a good reporter, it's also necessary for being a successful entrepreneur.&#10;&#10;@jayrosen_nyu So I'm seeing something very different from what you  see, it's not a bad sign at all. What matters is what he does, and how well it works, and who he delegates to and how well they do, etc.&#10;&#10;@jayrosen_nyu Here's the piece on NBB's.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/6R38GrrHge&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Just guessing that the people who will force people to get abortions are the same people who won't wear a mask to protect others.&#10;&#10;In other words, I'm not convinced this has anything to do with principles or religion.&#10;&#10;</description>
