			<description>Of course they got some kickass photos on Day 1 of the JWST, but man they need a few really web-art people to put their rollouts together. This is an artform, let the scientists talk to scientists, we the people want to WOW this stuff.&#10;https://t.co/OVE2p53QYC&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can't wait until we get the timeline of what Trump was doing while the battle of the capitol was going on. What snacks did he order from the white house kitchen. Who was he talking with on the phone? Was he sexually aroused?&#10;&#10;I thought it was pretty humiliating for the country when Clinton got blow jobs in the oval office. I think Trump managed to beat that.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jarango Thanks for speaking up. People question my motivation, I guess they think I plan to compete with them, but I don't. I believe in a networked writing and reading environment and any popular tool that doesn't network is a problem. It's not just Substack, by any means.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/6 I'm thinking a lot about RSS this year.&#10;&#10;2/6 As a reader, I have no problem with a publishing site like Substack only doing outbound RSS. All my reading tools can hook into their authors' writing. It's good.&#10;&#10;3/6 But as a writer, I can't use a system that doesn't do inbound RSS. It's the inverse of the silo problem.&#10;&#10;4/6 Such a site insists that I do all my writing on there. That's a deal-stopper because I already have my best writing tool and I do all my serious writing in that tool. It's as if a radio station insisted that I use their guitar to play music.&#10;&#10;5/6 Someday we'll look back on this practice and think how could we have missed something so obvious.&#10;&#10;6/6 I've asked writers who use Substack how they feel about this, with mixed results. None of the writers are thinking about it very much, apparently.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>imagine a person in a boat on the niagara river about to go over the falls. a reporter wants to cover both sides.&#10;the problem that needs solving is pretty clear, there aren't sides.&#10;when it gets that simple (like now) there's nothing left to debate. https://t.co/I34vgDeIle&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>watching the NASA press conference.&#10;they're talking to us as if we're in a college class.&#10;they talk about pictures -- i want pictures!!&#10;&#10;I give up. I'm in the middle of a workday, and I want to see what they have, why not show us a close-up of a reasonably close galaxy to blow our minds, give us something exciting to share. it's a big moment, and they should have thought more how to present it.&#10;&#10;i spent a lot of years learning how to do software demos, and then how to design software to demo well. it's important, otherwise your ideas and what you learn exist in a vacuum, and can't influence anyone.&#10;&#10;i know what it's like to be an expert in abstractions, that's what i am -- but you have to make it real for people who aren't experts and don't think in abstractions.&#10;&#10;then you test your demos with real people. see if they get anything from your demo. let them ask questions, if they don't have any the demo didn't work. if their questions have nothing to do with what you demoed it didn't work.&#10;&#10;how many demos have you seen where the demoer spends the first 10 minutes talking before doing any demoing? the demo begins immediately (unless you're steve jobs in his prime, when you get to tease).&#10;&#10;and you practice relentlessly, so when it finally comes time to do the big demo you could do it in your dreams.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@blaireerskine I totally agree. It's like everything -- they want us to solve the problem, but we empowered them to solve it. Now they want us to believe their inability to resist the Repub coup is our fault somehow.&#10;We need new Democrats. Ones who are up to fighting back.&#10;&#10;</description>
