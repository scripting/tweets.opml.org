			<description>@nilofer That's very heavy, or trying to be very heavy.&#10;Yes really -- I love my Tesla. I'm proud that America can make a product like that. Very proud.&#10;I could give you the same moral guilt trip about choices I'm sure you make, but what's the point.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ReasonedWriting @KenSmith One of the first outliners on PCs, a contemporary of my ThinkTank product, was called Framework.&#10;It was an integrated spreadsheet, graphics program, comm, etc and an outliner, for the PC.&#10;https://t.co/NUldnmEIEy&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>People get really pissy about Elon Musk. Why do they care so much? Such angst. His rockets work. I love the cars they make. Just ordered Skylink. There hasn't been a person since Steve Jobs who could get me to buy all their ideas. I respect that, even if you don't like him. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@pilhofer yes i understand -- when the pandemic hit i unsubbed from the athletic. they had nothing to cover.&#10;i think their subscriber base must have evaporated.&#10;i think this is their attempt to try to lure us back.&#10;hasn't worked with me yet. ;-)&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote @VladyslavSitalo @dvargas92495 @hashbrown490 @TfTHacker yes! i was hoping it would work that way when i did the package. no need to guess about how opml works.&#10;if you have questions about that code, it's very much part of what i'm working on now, so please let me know.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I tune into twitter it's the same four messages taking up the whole home page.&#10;The big downside in having an algorithm is that they have bugs and do shit like this.&#10;BTW, a bunch of them are about Morning Joe.&#10;I don't think he's even on now.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@pilhofer @jeffjarvis You're not missing anything. Any time I tune into it, within 5 minutes I'm channel surfing looking for a basketball game to watch.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote If I could read a Roam graph in Drummer, yes it's worth it. I want to understand more about how people use Roam.&#10;&#10;@phonetonote Right now I'm head-down on another project or I'd pick this up immediately and work with you on it.&#10;&#10;Anything that demonstrates interop here is worth it.&#10;&#10;This has to become the culture of idea processing, the idea of locking into one tool is unworkable imho.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TaylorLorenz that sounds like a great column for the washington post.&#10;what does twitter need to do to help people they haven't  been serving well.&#10;maybe there's a would-be competitor out there that can benefit from this thinking.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@phonetonote Okay let's do it. I am not familiar with datascript.&#10;Do you have an example file?&#10;Are there docs for the format?&#10;Here's the docs on OPML.&#10;https://t.co/UneKXbtPIA&#10;&#10;@phonetonote BTW, I've written a JavaScript package for reading and writing OPML files.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/Rk4917pyUt&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TaylorLorenz He might be really good for Twitter's board.&#10;He's actually made software, himself -- and presumably knows how to write a bug report.&#10;And he uses the product. I don't imagine too many of the other board members at Twitter really use it.&#10;Leadership from users, what a concept. ðŸ˜€&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/3 If you're a #toolsforthought person, you must've seen me beating the drum for interop between outliners. My preferred format is OPML, but if real interop is built with another format, I'll support it in Drummer.&#10;&#10;2/3 I eased up on my evangelism for OPML because the various teams in #tft seem busy focused on their own products, and aren't thinking a lot about interop these days, I guess. So I got to work on another project, but I'll be coming back to this. I do not give up easily. :-)&#10;&#10;3/3 In the meantime, all of my public outlines can be read in any tool that supports OPML. For example this outline of a talk I gave to a class at CUNY yesterday. A link in the next message in this thread.&#10;&#10;Here's the link...&#10;&#10;https://t.co/lMXpjtoMhI&#10;&#10;To get the OPML, click on the orange XML icon in the upper right corner of the page.&#10;&#10;And if you want to try my latest outliner..&#10;&#10;https://t.co/jBvvd07MwT&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jeffjarvis @verge I think we might see some movement on longstanding issues in Twitter. My complaint about Tesla is they move things around too much, but they do move. Twitter on the other hand moves at a glacial pace. I think this might be very good for Twitter (and its users).&#10;&#10;@jeffjarvis @verge Look at it this way -- they put a user on their board, and presumably a user who knows how to write a bug report.&#10;&#10;https://t.co/8eWglsLnIR&#10;&#10;There have been too many bankers and VCs and media company execs on Twitter's board. Imho of course.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ReasonedWriting @KenSmith I gave a talk at a class at CUNY yesterday and did an outline beforehand. I didnâ€™t need to refer to it, because outlining it put the structure in my mind, and I could work from that as I lectured.&#10;https://t.co/lMXpjtoMhI&#10;&#10;</description>
