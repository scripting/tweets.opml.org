			<description>We live in Putin's America. People seem to have forgotten. We let them in for four years at the top of our government. You don't just vote them out. They stick around. https://t.co/PkhZhsy0O7&#10;&#10;It's hard to get rid of a virus.

			<description>1/5 People assume Russia will keep marching after taking Ukraine and presumably assassinating its president, the lovely Volodymyr Zelenskyy. This was discussed at the end of today's Daily podcast, where the reporter and host agreed that Putin will have a problem if he has&#10;&#10;2/5 Zelenskyy assassinated. I'd like to propose an alternate theory. Once Zelenskyy is gone, Putin will give a speech saying that the Nazis did it. He will have a black ribbon on his lapel, the standard thing people will wear to mourn the death of Zelenskyy. He will say Russia&#10;&#10;3/5 entered Ukraine to protect Zelenskyy, not to kill him. They will round up some Ukrainian &quot;Nazis&quot; and kill them. The Russian army, their job done, will return home, leaving Uktraine to be run by a Putin puppet. I think this is much more likely than Putin repeating his mistake&#10;&#10;4/5 of invading Ukraine, or at least wait until a Putinite is in power in the US, and they've had a chance to withdraw from NATO, rendering it powerless,. Then all of Europe will recalculate and accept Russia as Stalin 2.0, and try to coexist, without the protection of the&#10;&#10;5/5 American nuclear shield. Putin can continue looting the United States, and get started on Europe.&#10;&#10;Don't forget, scattered throughout the governments of the world are figures who are being blackmailed by Putin. They can make things come out however he wants them to come out.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>good chance putin, assuming he reaches a conclusion in ukraine. he will say he loved zelensky, invaded to protect him, he grieves his passing and russian troops return home to wait out the dems, hoping a putinite to be elected president in 2024. more here&#10;https://t.co/YbnuY4kqBA&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TaylorLorenz taylor it's that way with the people who have climbed the ladder re people trying to get on the ladder.&#10;i'm older and have been an influencer. they didn't like it back then either. eventually journalism is going to be replaced by people reporting the news for themselves.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>1/8 I didn't realize what the disagreement was between Maggie Haberman and Taylor Lorenz.&#10;&#10;2/8 I think I, as a user of news, represent a third point of view. I think we need to reboot the news, have needed to do that for a long time.&#10;&#10;3/8 I want news that is of the people, by the people and for the people. I don't think people should have big careers in news. A journalist is like a piece of networking hardware or software, they connect the experience and expertise of all of us to each other. They've gotten so&#10;&#10;4/8 far off track, they don't have any actual contact with people who aren't influencers in the TL sense of it or people in power in the MH model.&#10;&#10;5/8 I don't want any of that. I want to be informed and I want fresh ideas. And if I can't get it from journalism, I'll seek it out elsewhere. I had hoped that that process would have yielded something more tangible by now, but we are still controlled by journalism, and as i've&#10;&#10;6/8 written elsewhere, they are not in any way accountable to us. That's not a good situation.&#10;&#10;7/8 I doubt if any journalists will read this and if they do, I'm sure they'll find a way to dismiss it -- they always do.&#10;&#10;8/8 BTW, I used to be an influencer, often quoted in journalism, both off and on the record. I even did a little pseudo journalism as a contributing editor at Wired for a couple of years in the 90s.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A non-kleptocratic Russia would consider NATO pointless, obsolete, go ahead have your NATO, just buy our products and come here on vacation. Russians would spend their rubles in other countries and eventually NATO would wither and die on its own.&#10;&#10;</description>
