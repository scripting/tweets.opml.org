				<outline text="interop is the answer to dominance by large companies. 

a perfect time to build a ring of interop now is around Wordle clones. 

the word of the day should be the same across all clones, and there should be a single place where users' history is stored." type="tweet" created="Tue, 01 Feb 2022 16:55:16 GMT" tweetId="1488556568945872896" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1488556568945872896" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
