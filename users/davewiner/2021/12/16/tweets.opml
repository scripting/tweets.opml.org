				<outline text="You know when you try to help people get their questions answered, if you don't do it just the way they want you to, you can expect to be flamed. 

If you do nothing, they don't flame you.

There's a penalty for caring.

This is the way of the world, I've learned, sadly." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 17:45:21 GMT" tweetId="1471536941824892933" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471536941824892933" inReplyToId="" tweetUserName="davewiner" />
				<outline text="@sandbags -- if you really want to try to use Drummer, here's how to do it.

1. Allocate some time to explore the product. You came in wanting full knowledge of what the product can do, for something no one else uses it for as far as i know. That can't happen in a few hours." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:13 GMT" tweetId="1471482298038169600" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482298038169600" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
					<outline text="2. I suggest using the RFC site to initiate your query, and start with a brief intro of what you're trying to do to get people interested. 

3. From there, once you're on a track that's likely to work, start documenting problems you hit, in one thread on the support site, not 19." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:13 GMT" tweetId="1471482299644616709" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482299644616709" inReplyToId="1471482298038169600" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
						<outline text="4. If no one shows up to help, so be it. I find for a lot of the projects I want to do, no one shows up to help. People are busy. You know what I mean, you didn't participate in the test group even though you had access." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:14 GMT" tweetId="1471482300890296324" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482300890296324" inReplyToId="1471482299644616709" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
							<outline text="5. I was out all day yesterday and got home to an onslaught of Matt Mower. Even so, I did try to concentrate your query for you, and posted a note in the change notes outline. But I suspect all anyone saw when they looked was confusion so they hit the Back button." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:14 GMT" tweetId="1471482302433841160" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482302433841160" inReplyToId="1471482300890296324" tweetUserName="davewiner" >

				<outline text="MSNBC is missing something. The Fox people were freaking out because it could have been a Jonestown in the Capitol on January 6, with Congress being massacred. They must’ve been humanly scared the way we all were. Trump the sadist was hoping for a massacre." type="tweet" created="Wed, 15 Dec 2021 01:19:10 GMT" tweetId="1470926373225218059" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1470926373225218059" tweetUserName="davewiner" />

				<outline text="#toolsforthought users want fluidity of their data, and independence from any single vendor.

They are cynical about tech, and have every right to be, based on experience. 

They know all about lock-in. 

They've never experienced the early days of a platform with huge potential" type="tweet" created="Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:05:03 GMT" tweetId="1470771824812335110" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1470771824812335110" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
					<outline text="It's not too late to transform Tools For Thought into that kind of platform, fluid and no vendor owning all the users. It can be even better than the web, why not -- we have learned from the web. 

I think we're going to do it. The technology is simple, we just need the will." type="tweet" created="Tue, 14 Dec 2021 15:05:03 GMT" tweetId="1470771826318102542" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1470771826318102542" inReplyToId="1470771824812335110" tweetUserName="davewiner" />

				<outline text="Watching the news tonight I couldn't stand the cowardice of the commentators. 

When is one of them going to say look here's the deal, Trump is a sadist.

That explains all that they claim to be so inexplicable. 

He's a sadist. Next question." type="tweet" created="Tue, 14 Dec 2021 01:56:55 GMT" tweetId="1470573484707401731" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1470573484707401731" tweetUserName="davewiner" />
