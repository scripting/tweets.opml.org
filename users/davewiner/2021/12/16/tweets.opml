				<outline text="You know when you try to help people get their questions answered, if you don't do it just the way they want you to, you can expect to be flamed.

				<outline text="BTW, I'd add to the list of things you'll have on your runway -- a Peloton. I will have one too of course. And a Tesla. ;-)" type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:53:26 GMT" tweetId="1471508775957712903" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471508775957712903" inReplyToId="1471508572483710987" tweetUserName="davewiner" />
				<outline text="I find it really interesting to watch the evolution as you go back in time. 

First there were &quot;glossary entries&quot; -- then we used [[tagging]], now forget all that pre-thought. It's all just indexed, so you can make up a tag after the fact." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:45:12 GMT" tweetId="1471506706446184464" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471506706446184464" inReplyToId="1471506325477617675" tweetUserName="davewiner" />
				<outline text="@GeorgeSilverman @rroudt @monicalimco @obsdmd @logseq Re preserving your Obsidian data files, we haven't gotten to the point yet where we try to read the &quot;attributed markdown&quot; docs (that's how i think of them). I'm still holding out hope that the basis for interop can be OPML, which is imho better prepared than Markdown for outining" type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:13:03 GMT" tweetId="1471483517183868935" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471483517183868935" inReplyToId="1471483039259705345" tweetUserName="davewiner" />
				<outline text="@sandbags -- if you really want to try to use Drummer, here's how to do it.

1. Allocate some time to explore the product. You came in wanting full knowledge of what the product can do, for something no one else uses it for as far as i know. That can't happen in a few hours." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:13 GMT" tweetId="1471482298038169600" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482298038169600" inReplyToId="" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
					<outline text="2. I suggest using the RFC site to initiate your query, and start with a brief intro of what you're trying to do to get people interested. 

3. From there, once you're on a track that's likely to work, start documenting problems you hit, in one thread on the support site, not 19." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:13 GMT" tweetId="1471482299644616709" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482299644616709" inReplyToId="1471482298038169600" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
						<outline text="4. If no one shows up to help, so be it. I find for a lot of the projects I want to do, no one shows up to help. People are busy. You know what I mean, you didn't participate in the test group even though you had access." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:14 GMT" tweetId="1471482300890296324" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482300890296324" inReplyToId="1471482299644616709" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
							<outline text="5. I was out all day yesterday and got home to an onslaught of Matt Mower. Even so, I did try to concentrate your query for you, and posted a note in the change notes outline. But I suspect all anyone saw when they looked was confusion so they hit the Back button." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:14 GMT" tweetId="1471482302433841160" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482302433841160" inReplyToId="1471482300890296324" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
