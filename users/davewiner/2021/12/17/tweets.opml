					<outline text="Another observation.

There's been little focus in the #toolsforthought category about writing publicly, it's mostly been focused on mind-mapping for personal use.

In my outliners the focus is publishing. Given my background in blogging and podcasting, makes sense. ;-)" type="tweet" created="Fri, 17 Dec 2021 14:45:17 GMT" tweetId="1471854015050924037" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471854015050924037" inReplyToId="1471853464900804608" tweetUserName="davewiner" />

				<outline text="Or we can't trust Google to index our docs and blogs. They're going backward, taking advantage of what they perceive as an impenetrable dominance. Daytona has proven, for me at least, they are not." type="tweet" created="Fri, 17 Dec 2021 14:28:10 GMT" tweetId="1471849708134014984" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471849708134014984" inReplyToId="1471848755674689538" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
					<outline text="I think the real &quot;Web3&quot; will happen when we decide it's time to route around Google. It's totally possible.

				<outline text="You know when you try to help people get their questions answered, if you don't do it just the way they want you to, you can expect to be flamed. 

If you do nothing, they don't flame you.

There's a penalty for caring.

This is the way of the world, I've learned, sadly." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 17:45:21 GMT" tweetId="1471536941824892933" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471536941824892933" tweetUserName="davewiner" />

				<outline text="I find it really interesting to watch the evolution as you go back in time. 

First there were &quot;glossary entries&quot; -- then we used [[tagging]], now forget all that pre-thought.

				<outline text="@GeorgeSilverman @rroudt @monicalimco @obsdmd @logseq Re preserving your Obsidian data files, we haven't gotten to the point yet where we try to read the &quot;attributed markdown&quot; docs (that's how i think of them).

				<outline text="@sandbags -- if you really want to try to use Drummer, here's how to do it.

1. Allocate some time to explore the product. You came in wanting full knowledge of what the product can do, for something no one else uses it for as far as i know. That can't happen in a few hours." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:13 GMT" tweetId="1471482298038169600" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482298038169600" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
					<outline text="2. I suggest using the RFC site to initiate your query, and start with a brief intro of what you're trying to do to get people interested. 

3. From there, once you're on a track that's likely to work, start documenting problems you hit, in one thread on the support site, not 19." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:13 GMT" tweetId="1471482299644616709" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482299644616709" inReplyToId="1471482298038169600" tweetUserName="davewiner" >

							<outline text="5. I was out all day yesterday and got home to an onslaught of Matt Mower. Even so, I did try to concentrate your query for you, and posted a note in the change notes outline. But I suspect all anyone saw when they looked was confusion so they hit the Back button." type="tweet" created="Thu, 16 Dec 2021 14:08:14 GMT" tweetId="1471482302433841160" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1471482302433841160" inReplyToId="1471482300890296324" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
