				<outline text="@jeffjarvis @danalacey @ElieNYC I have a contrarian point of view. I think if one of these pubs decided to make it pay-as-you-go it would be so popular with readers that it would make the others want to be part of something like this.

				<outline text="@danalacey @jeffjarvis @ElieNYC I hate the term micropayments because it implies that thereâ€™s very little money in it.

				<outline text="@jeffjarvis @ElieNYC Maybe for some pubs, like the NYT and WP, unbundling would result in lost revenue.
