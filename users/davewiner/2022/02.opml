				<outline text="I'm sorry that the NYT bought Wordle. 

Part of its appeal was that it was a nice web app that had no scaling issues, written by a person who was happy not to be a billionaire, and everyone was loving it.

Now that it's attached to the NYT, there's an element of hate there too." type="tweet" created="Tue, 01 Feb 2022 12:45:27 GMT" tweetId="1488493699076173830" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1488493699076173830" inReplyToId="" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
					<outline text="I thought maybe it would show the world that ordinary people who love their GF and wants to make something nice for her and decides to share it with the world and retains his human-ness -- that software can be fun and doesn't have to be this hot mess of greed." type="tweet" created="Tue, 01 Feb 2022 12:49:23 GMT" tweetId="1488494687891636235" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1488494687891636235" inReplyToId="1488493699076173830" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
						<outline text="BTW this is true, software *is* made by people, not icons, and I don't blame Mr Wordle for taking the money. I just hope he stays a nice person and doesn't get caught up in being more than a human being." type="tweet" created="Tue, 01 Feb 2022 12:49:23 GMT" tweetId="1488494689170997250" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1488494689170997250" inReplyToId="1488494687891636235" tweetUserName="davewiner" />

				<outline text="I read in the NYT this morning that inflation is up and people are mad. 

I didn't read the article, I'm too scared, because they always make things sound terrible for Biden, when in truth, inflation is the result of a strong economy." type="tweet" created="Tue, 01 Feb 2022 12:43:34 GMT" tweetId="1488493225308344323" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1488493225308344323" inReplyToId="" tweetUserName="davewiner" >
					<outline text="If you want inflation to flatten or go down, just start a recession and inflation will go down. 

Raise interest rates. Your savings will go up in value, and your adjustable rate mortgage will go up too.

There are few silver bullets in economics." type="tweet" created="Tue, 01 Feb 2022 12:43:34 GMT" tweetId="1488493227200163840" urltweet="https://twitter.com/davewiner/status/1488493227200163840" inReplyToId="1488493225308344323" tweetUserName="davewiner" />
