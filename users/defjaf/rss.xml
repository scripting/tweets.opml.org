			<description>@jr_pritchard I don’t even think the latter part is how it’s being used (i.e., on the @ImperialPhysics sites that we are implicitly discussing). I think it is just being used as a fancy way but incorrect way of saying “form”.&#10;&#10;@jr_pritchard @ImperialPhysics A “pro forma” document is supposed to be already filled in!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>“Proforma” does not mean “blank form for you to fill in”, even in the UK, right?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It's almost impossible to believe now that the 1989 TV movie “Roe vs Wade” was broadcast on NBC to some acclaim, and (correctly) portrayed the 1972 decision as a heroic triumph for civil liberties.  https://t.co/qok1rOcL62&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It is the summer solstice so time for my annual reminiscence of seeing Sun Ra and Don Cherry celebrate the rising sun from Battery Park in Manhattan with @disquiet back in 1989.&#10;Perhaps one day I’ll make it out to Stonehenge with the druids. https://t.co/OqDn8sCDLA&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@petermurrayrust It’s (obviously?) an artifact of using a screenshot as a figure — it’s a “magnifying glass” icon. If you realise that, it’s not confusing. But (also obviously?) the journal should demand this be fixed.&#10;&#10;@petermurrayrust Or, you were reading this online and it really was a clickable magnifying glass icon! In which case it’s sort of exactly correct and a convention of the internet (&amp;amp; online articles in particular) that most (not all!) readers will understand.&#10;&#10;@petermurrayrust h/t @yvonnenobis&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@comiXology On the purchasing side, please let us select multiple comics for purchase before completing the sale (I.e., a basket!). And let us stay on exactly the same page after a purchase.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jr_pritchard Lucky you! I just finished my exams — but I’ve still got project reports to mark.&#10;&#10;@jr_pritchard I also note mild linguistic irony that I wrote “mark” and you wrote “grading”.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I was out of contact for five days, four of which were holiday or weekend, and it still took me over two hours to deal with all the accumulated emails and messages.&#10;&#10;</description>
