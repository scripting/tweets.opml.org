			<description>I just turned into the oilers/flames game. There have been (checks notes) FOUR goals in two minutes.&#10;#BattleOfAlberta is delivering some amazing hockey. Glad I'm rooting for great hockey and don't really care that much who wins. This game must be cardiac arrest on ice for fans&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EvanM_Brown I wasn't suggesting the ESPN announcers we're encouraging a harder hit. Sorry I implied that.&#10;It sounded to my ear that the ESPN announcers were suggesting Lucic didn't deserve as much as he got Maybe others heard it differently. major + misconduct seemed like perfect penalty&#10;&#10;@EvanM_Brown But it was funny that the ref didn't even bother to list off the SIX roughing penalties that were also assessed on the play individually. I liked his &quot;I've had just about enough of y'all's bull shit&quot; energy&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>&quot;Everybody else sitting in the penalty box gets two minutes for roughing&quot;&#10;Refs of EDM/CGY series have an insanely hard job. My hats off to them.&#10;That ESPN announcer tho. &quot;Lucic could have hit the goalie a lot harder&quot; is not the smokin' hot take the announcer thinks it is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Holy crap. Evander Kane with a natural hat trick in 6 fucking minutes. Not a big Oilers fan, but that kind of performance is astounding to watch. Oilers look unstoppable, even having lost game one 9-6&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>NW🦀 in the championship game of the Windy City Spring Classic.&#10;Any suggestions for Chicago area sight seeing would be appreciated. We're going to go after the game (and showers for players)&#10;We saw Wrigley already and won't be done at rink in time for today's Cubs game.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>So you can't remotely reset your iPhone without the 2FA code on the iPhone that you can't access? What a completely fucked up design.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Chicago ice facilities are very nice. Across the three facilities we've been too in two days, I've seen EIGHT sheets of ice, one sheet of synthetic ice, and three snack bars, three restaurants with full bar and a beer garden. Wish Seattle had this kind of hockey infrastructure&#10;&#10;Beer selection has been crap tho. I mean, maybe it was good at this morning's rink - bar wasn't open at 9:30am. But when your darkest beer is an amber, you have an objectively shitty beer selection&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>NW🦀 get the win in their second game of the Windy City Spring Classic 6-1. Yesterday, they took a while to get started. Today they started solid, got a little lazy late, but had built enough of a lead that it didn't matter.&#10;&#10;Patrick picked up the crabs' final goal this morning. Knocked the puck out of the air and down to his stick above the crease and then banged it home.&#10;&#10;Today's my birthday so he really wanted to score at this tournament. Mission Accomplished&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@davemangot Uhh, not sure why you think that. I'm not drinking much right now as I try to lose more weight, but I absolutely drink beer. Will look for this one&#10;&#10;@davemangot Not sure I can hit a bar with Patrick's 18u team, but there are a couple places near by that has it for sale. Not a big IPA guy, but I'll try it with a recommendation like that&#10;&#10;@davemangot #ProofOfBeer https://t.co/vVKc9gQwA3&#10;&#10;@davemangot IPAs. Still not my thing&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I'm in Chicago this weekend for the Windy City Spring Classic - my son's last 18u hockey tournament. NW Crabs win game one 4-0 and Patrick gets an assist.&#10;&#10;My niece lives downtown, so we are getting dinner by the ballpark https://t.co/y5dXZqwdPb&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Took off work early to see new Dr Strange movie. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.&#10;Doesn't hold a candle to #EverythingEverywhereAllAtOnce.&#10;I'd say @Marvel should hire the @Daniels, but I suspect they would end up having to peace out like @edgarwright did on ant man.&#10;&#10;</description>
