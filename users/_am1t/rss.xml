			<description>I have been using my phone caseless for the past few days. I don’t remember the last time I appreciated the design of these devices this much. I am convinced now that the cases kill the uniqueness, the identity of the devices. https://t.co/qnpZC2QZPb&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I remember I had tried Typora once as a Markdown editor, and I was impressed even then. I got to know today that it’s available on Linux too. The feature set looks promising. I will give it a try, with Atom no longer an option. https://t.co/TG7S2p1RCv&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What a terrible move this from the end users' perspective. It's unfortunate that Google is taking Android towards a closed ecosystem, undoing its benefits over iOS one at a time. This needs correction, soon. https://t.co/P45xfkbkRc&#10;&#10;</description>
