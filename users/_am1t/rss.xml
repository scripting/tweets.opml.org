			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find and read a lot of brilliant articles/essays throughout the day. Most are shareworthy which I freely do. But I have realised too much reading is unfavourable for my writing. The mind gets inundated with others&amp;#39; thoughts.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;There are times when I know I want to write about something, but I can’t think of anything. This is one such moment. Plus I am too sleepy to dig into my mind. So I am making this note to slightly pacify my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I suck at emojis – I don’t understand this language. Why are there so many representations of the quality of laughter? Grinning, Smiling, Beaming and whatnot. I understand each word means something different, but conveying that through the right emoji ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XJ8GKySYSZ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/XJ8GKySYSZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;These stunning images are a major achievement for us Earthlings. And given everything absurd we’ve witnessed on Earth of late, they are more than that.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I ranted about how Youtube is aggressively pushing Shorts in their feeds and recommendations. Of course, the quality had taken a huge nosedive.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;A few years back, I stopped watching Elementary after the last episode of the first season. I didn’t like that it stopped being what it was good at - a riveting procedural drama.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It has been raining incessantly here for the past week. So when the Sun shone through clouds momentarily, the whole neighbourhood decided to turn up on the roads. It didn’t matter that the skies were still crowded with clouds and it would rain soon. Too much of anything is bad.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;As far as time wastage goes, short video services are the new social media. YouTube Shorts, Reels whatever.
