			<description>I had no idea Pebble (or at least part of it) was purchased by Fitbit. Almost 6 years back. So unfortunate we didn‚Äôt see any launches of inspired products from Fitbit. One with an e-paper display and good battery life. I would have loved such a ... https://t.co/l3m4KvVgCc&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can‚Äôt remember the last time I enjoyed listening to a book as much as Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. Of course, Weir deserves a lot of credit for writing such a smart book. But I am equally impressed by the performance, the voice acting by Ray ... https://t.co/DKM3kcnJYl&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets!&#10;Elon Musk‚Äôs reply to a (long) Twitter thread. It would be pretty interesting to see Twitter allow longform ‚Äútweets‚Äù. No one sees Twitter yet ... https://t.co/dRySE2Mhqp&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Elon Musk wants to own and take Twitter private then? This might be good for users but terrible for current employees, right? Or good for both? Or may be not for either? Hmm. I don‚Äôt have enough knowledge about many things.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am tired of websites with pop downs asking for permission to show notifications. Why would I enable that? Notifications are already a headache to manage, even the ones just from the apps. Why would I let websites also bug me incessantly?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>My daughter has reached an age now where she lip syncs to songs, mostly pop, in front of the mirror. Of course, using the comb as a mic. Sigh! It‚Äôs going to be tricky to keep up.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Apple needs to launch a TV+ app for Android. They have one for music. So I can‚Äôt understand why they won‚Äôt launch one for their TV offerings too. It‚Äôs such a pain to watch their shows and movies on a non-Apple mobile device. And I won‚Äôt buy an Apple device just for TV.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>At times I feel everyone other than me is doing so much with their time while I sit here blank, staring at the screen. Not doing every thing that I should be doing. It sucks when this thought strikes.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have been very keen on listening to Audiobooks recently. The moment I have some spare time, I am listening to the audiobooks. That does not bode well for my other interests. I also blame the brilliant collection of books I have been recommendedüôÉ.&#10;&#10;</description>
