			<description>Did you know you can import data directly from a webpage with MS Excel, as table? I didn‚Äôt. Just go to Data -&amp;gt; Get Data From Web -&amp;gt; Enter URL with table and boom! I used to copy the table and paste it in when I needed to. Just like they did in.. uhmm.. stone-age, I guess? ü§Ø&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Over the years, I have had many wrong perceptions and I have realised that the assumption that how I experience something is precisely how everyone all over the world experiences it is the root for many. Now I pause, think, and only then make up my mind.&#10;&#10;</description>
