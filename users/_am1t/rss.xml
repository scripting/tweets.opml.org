			<description>&lt;p&gt;I wish there was a technology that could capture the smell you are experiencing, just the way you can the colours with a camera.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The quality of @amazonIN&amp;#39;s prime delivery has significantly degraded in recent times. Two orders in two days that were out of delivery were marked as &amp;quot;attempted delivery&amp;quot; when the agents didn&amp;#39;t even arrive at our houses. The delivery agency&amp;#39;s found a loophole they are milking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
