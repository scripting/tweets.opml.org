			<description>&lt;p&gt;In 1967, the Jornal do Brasil asked Clarice Lispector to write a Saturday newspaper column on any topic she wished. For nearly seven years, she wrote weekly, covering a wide range of topics—humans and animals, bad dinner parties, the daily activities ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pC2R4CUa20&quot;&gt;https://t.co/pC2R4CUa20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AmazonHelp You have missed them terribly. You misplaced 2 orders, delayed by 2 days. And then your support says it will take another 3 days. This is with the one-day delivery promise on both orders.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;The quality of @amazonIN&amp;#39;s prime delivery has significantly degraded in recent times. Two orders in two days that were out of delivery were marked as &amp;quot;attempted delivery&amp;quot; when the agents didn&amp;#39;t even arrive at our houses. The delivery agency&amp;#39;s found a loophole they are milking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a word cloud of my posts that I created in 2008 – I had been blogging for around 2 years then. I find it funny that even then I was writing the most about “blog”. Apparently, meta-commentary never goes out of fashion. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/2fO2zPgP6z&quot;&gt;https://t.co/2fO2zPgP6z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I understand why Google is doing the #GetTheMessage campaign. I also understand why it would hardly affect Apple. It’s a loss for users all over the world though. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/tKNXfdeAyb&quot;&gt;https://t.co/tKNXfdeAyb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Is Apple breaking my texting experience?

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled across the first iterations of my blog that I had self-hosted with WordPress.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I loved the trailer for Vengeance, looks so much fun. But I don’t think it’s going to be in theaters around here anytime soon.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find it surprising that iTunes remain the only good store to buy digital music even today. There has to be some reason that all the big players have exited the space and have gone the streaming route. Is it the competition? Or the overall logistics of selling digital music?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
