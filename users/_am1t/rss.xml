			<description>I love what Grammarly can do ‚Äì but boy, its Premium tier is costly. Ironically, every time it corrects me, I want to pay for the service. But then I see how much it costs &amp;amp; I can‚Äôt convince myself that I need it enough. I tried LanguageTool for a year, but reconsidering now.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I am tired of even the simple utility apps going for subscription model instead of right out one-time purchases.

			<description>I am looking forward to today‚Äôs qualifier between RR and RCB. I have always loved the play RR plays ‚Äì always the underdogs on paper, but punch above their weight.

			<description>I let my subscription to the Freedom service expire today. I intend to do the same for Pocket soon. I don‚Äôt get enough benefit from either of these services.

			<description>I like how the playoffs have lined up in this year‚Äôs IPL. The teams that played the best are the ones at the top. None is there that shouldn‚Äôt be.

			<description>I recently finished watching The Lincoln Lawyer on Netflix. It‚Äôs a good, bingeworthy series. Nothing‚Äôs great about it, but if all one wants is to binge a show over the weekend, this is one option. The things keep moving.
