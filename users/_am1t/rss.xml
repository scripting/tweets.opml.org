			<description>I suck at emojis – I don’t understand this language. Why are there so many representations of the quality of laughter? Grinning, Smiling, Beaming and whatnot. I understand each word means something different, but conveying that through the right emoji ... https://t.co/XJ8GKySYSZ&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>These stunning images are a major achievement for us Earthlings. And given everything absurd we’ve witnessed on Earth of late, they are more than that. If nothing else, the humongousness of the universe ought to put our problems into perspective. A ... https://t.co/8B7zqtj5IH&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Did anyone think the drama around Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter will play out any differently? Normally, that is? Is anything that this guy does conventional?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yesterday, I ranted about how Youtube is aggressively pushing Shorts in their feeds and recommendations. Of course, the quality had taken a huge nosedive. Well, just look at the explore tab of YouTube. I very rarely do, that section always had ... https://t.co/E2hOghgDnL&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A few years back, I stopped watching Elementary after the last episode of the first season. I didn’t like that it stopped being what it was good at - a riveting procedural drama. I recently started watching the second season and even this season had ... https://t.co/ibzQdeC7yV&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It has been raining incessantly here for the past week. So when the Sun shone through clouds momentarily, the whole neighbourhood decided to turn up on the roads. It didn’t matter that the skies were still crowded with clouds and it would rain soon. Too much of anything is bad.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>As far as time wastage goes, short video services are the new social media. YouTube Shorts, Reels whatever. I have realized this mindless format of the content is eating up too much of my productive time. YouTube, in itself, was bad. But at least ... https://t.co/YqeFylFB23&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I finished reading The Comfort Book by Matt Haig today. Though I really enjoyed this book, I don’t think I am done reading it. I will keep this book close and revisit a chapter randomly whenever I feel down. Or feel that I need a nudge in the right ... https://t.co/GRYYj84Pp8&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Almost every morning, I get a notification from Day One reminding me of an entry I had made on this day in some previous year. It always brings a smile to my face. Most entries are from some 8-10 years back when my daughter was growing up. I am so ... https://t.co/AXzAw8BTxz&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>My caseless device had the first fall today, thankfully a minor one. But until I picked it up and looked for cracks and dents, my mind was racing like crazy. Not a good feeling this. Yuck!&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Read widely. Read some books more than once. Write in your books. Don’t finish every book you start. You might be able to read 2500 books in your lifetime. Maybe a few more than that. It’s still a very small number. Choose wisely.&#10;Source: My Twelve ... https://t.co/9SX9SNvJGI&#10;&#10;</description>
