			<description>It‚Äôs best to put emoji at the very end of your written content which also means not using them as bullet points.

			<description>I let my subscription to the Freedom service expire today. I intend to do the same for Pocket soon. I don‚Äôt get enough benefit from either of these services. Plus I am at the peak of subscription fatigue now. Am done with annual subscriptions, doesn‚Äôt matter how cheap they are.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Every time I listen to the song Daryaa from Manmarziyaan, I am reminded of the genius of Amit Trivedi. It‚Äôs such an intricate, yet equally simple song.

			<description>In line with one of my recent posts about writing for audience, this is a wonderful quote from Leo Tolstoy (h/t James Clear).&#10;If you care too much about being praised, in the end you will not accomplish anything serious.

			<description>I use Firefox on Windows/iOS/Android and Safari on Mac. But the comparison that Brave publishes is effective. Browsers are sticky, there‚Äôs rarely an incentive to switch.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I like how the playoffs have lined up in this year‚Äôs IPL. The teams that played the best are the ones at the top. None is there that shouldn‚Äôt be. I would love a new champion this time, that means I support only one team of the remaining three ‚Äî the Gujarat Titans.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I recently finished watching The Lincoln Lawyer on Netflix. It‚Äôs a good, bingeworthy series. Nothing‚Äôs great about it, but if all one wants is to binge a show over the weekend, this is one option. The things keep moving. No performance is painful, no side-story unbearable.&#10;&#10;</description>
