			<description>&lt;p&gt;I donâ€™t get Appleâ€™s iPhone 14 lineup. Let me be upfront and say I have no intention of being an asshole. Or to troll Apple. I am genuinely curious if Apple has improved iPhone 14 (non-Pro) in any significant way over the last yearâ€™s model. Even S ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FQLYHK0oC0&quot;&gt;https://t.co/FQLYHK0oC0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I didnâ€™t follow the Apple event live â€“ I was sleeping peacefully, unaware of what Apple was announcing. Iâ€™d also skipped the WWDC and Google I/O keynotes. Knowing that the improvements will only be incremental, my excitement for these tech events has dwindled in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I love the visits to the library with my daughter. She loves spending time amidst the books â€“ strolling through aisles, looking excitedly at the varied genres of books. Of course, she hasnâ€™t read them all (duh!), but making her choose her book for the day is a difficult task.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I finished reading Think Again by Adam Grant today ðŸ“š&#10;Though the book is in no way short, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Some on oneâ€™s personal life, ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/twuaB0nbP0&quot;&gt;https://t.co/twuaB0nbP0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Unless you have skipped a lot of school, or work, or both â€“ or you live in the USA â€“ you have probably used an A4 sheet of paper before now.

Time to dust off some high-school level maths to ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/TzFbsM5zoZ&quot;&gt;https://t.co/TzFbsM5zoZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I have been using a MacBook with Touch Bar for the past couple of weeks. I used this panel regularly for the first time. I can see why Apple wanted this to stick â€“ when it works, it works well. For example, Zoom puts the buttons for full screen, mute, ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pJtIsTGLxz&quot;&gt;https://t.co/pJtIsTGLxz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
