			<description>I upgraded to Galaxy S22 today. I love the design of this phone, plus the feel in the hand. Itâ€™s compact, yet powerful. I also like what Samsung has done with Android. This possibly is the best compact smartphone out there. Not just with Android.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I donâ€™t care about Wordle streaks. Rather, I canâ€™t. I never solve it at a single device and so never manage a streak. Well, thatâ€™s not the only reason, either. I donâ€™t solve it daily anyway.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>After a break of 3 weeks, I sent out the email letter with posts from the last weeks. The posts werenâ€™t many, but I like to write and share these letters. I usually do not write them ahead of time. I do so when I receive the schedule reminder. It ... https://t.co/iI1mj4earY&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Todayâ€™s Wordle was tricky. Two tries in and I had a big smile on my face. I am sure I wasnâ€™t alone.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rajvj I am surprised and saddened that such scams still work. I need to be continuously informing my close ones to ignore these.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Not visiting timelines was refreshing. I donâ€™t think this experiment will stay though. Being stagnant online is not something I like. Thatâ€™s what I become when Iâ€™m not reading otherâ€™s thoughts. Funny how our minds work â€“ you give it more space, it stretches and goes to sleep.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>iPhone SE is a lazy upgrade â€” Apple is a boring company. If there is one thing that will dent the juggernaut that is Apple, it is their tendency to play safe to cater to the majority. We need to sell in millions, so we canâ€™t experiment too much on ... https://t.co/F7ozrCK6pf&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have recently been a lot picky about the stuff I buy. Or the subscriptions I sign up for. Or the projects I undertake. I was never good at it. And I donâ€™t claim that I have mastered the skill now. I still struggle to recognise the price that I would ... https://t.co/uH8taN003T&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have been away on vacation since the last few days â€“ I had no network I could connect to. My hotel did provide me an option to connect to Wifi, an offer that I humbly declined. As a result, I donâ€™t remember any visit to a beach that was this peaceful. https://t.co/s0eAXodF1h&#10;&#10;</description>
