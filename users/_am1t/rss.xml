			<description>&lt;p&gt;I am not a horror movie fan. I have seen a few over the years but do not enjoy them. With age, my patience with them has further gone down. I do not watch this genre at all anymore. Or so I thought.&#10;I was recently reminded of my dislike as I read this ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/oZnRyLOL4z&quot;&gt;https://t.co/oZnRyLOL4z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched The Gray Man today – mindless action is not entertainment to me. I had fun when it was in superhero films. It doesn’t here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I find it surprising that iTunes remain the only good store to buy digital music even today. There has to be some reason that all the big players have exited the space and have gone the streaming route. Is it the competition? Or the overall logistics of selling digital music?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I watched The Batman today – I am glad that after a few terrible few showings, we have a good setting again. It’s not a perfect movie – it’s too long and too thin. But I loved the way it’s shot, it does “look and sound brilliant”. The first half is ... &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/a1d2FuTRFS&quot;&gt;https://t.co/a1d2FuTRFS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was 10 years ago today that I began a seven-day challenge not to log in to Facebook. I haven’t seen that timeline since then. It was a good, eye-opening challenge in that sense. Nice!&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

Delete any sentence not worthy of its own line.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Source: Writing one sentence per line | Derek Sivers → &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VUQ1tUFGVX&quot;&gt;https://t.co/VUQ1tUFGVX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
