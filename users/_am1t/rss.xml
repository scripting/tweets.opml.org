			<description>Twitter‚Äôs most committed users often love the service and hate it with equal passion, two feelings that can coexist without much cognitive dissonance.

			<description>The name ‚ÄòEast Timor‚Äô is a tautological toponym, meaning ‚Äòtimor‚Äô is Malay for ‚Äòeast‚Äô and ‚Äòeast‚Äô means, well, ‚Äòeast‚Äô. So, East Timor actually means East East.&#10;There is so much I didn‚Äôt know about from the above fact about East Timor from this week‚Äôs ... https://t.co/Zy9sa1VpPz&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I can never wear my watch while sleeping. I want my sleep to be comfortable ‚Äì one with a watch hugging my wrist isn‚Äôt. However, I am interested in recording my sleep pattern. It was possible with fitness bands, no longer is with a smartwatch.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wanted to watch Dune recently and I thought it had to be a Netflix original. No idea why I thought so, but I somehow assume everything that is streaming first is brought to us by Netflix. Funny that‚Äôs often not the case.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets!&#10;Elon Musk‚Äôs reply to a (long) Twitter thread.

			<description>Elon Musk wants to own and take Twitter private then? This might be good for users but terrible for current employees, right? Or good for both? Or may be not for either? Hmm. I don‚Äôt have enough knowledge about many things.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Apple needs to launch a TV+ app for Android. They have one for music. So I can‚Äôt understand why they won‚Äôt launch one for their TV offerings too. It‚Äôs such a pain to watch their shows and movies on a non-Apple mobile device. And I won‚Äôt buy an Apple device just for TV.&#10;&#10;</description>
