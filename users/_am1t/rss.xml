			<description>Almost every morning, I get a notification from Day One reminding me of an entry I had made on this day in some previous year. It always brings a smile to my face. Most entries are from some 8-10 years back when my daughter was growing up. I am so ... https://t.co/AXzAw8BTxz&#10;&#10;</description>
