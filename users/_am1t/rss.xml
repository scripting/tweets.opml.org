			<description>Apple needs to launch a TV+ app for Android. They have one for music. So I canâ€™t understand why they wonâ€™t launch one for their TV offerings too. Itâ€™s such a pain to watch their shows and movies on a non-Apple mobile device. And I wonâ€™t buy an Apple device just for TV.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>At times I feel everyone other than me is doing so much with their time while I sit here blank, staring at the screen. Not doing every thing that I should be doing. It sucks when this thought strikes.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Redacting takes time. You canâ€™t edit pictures by thinking; you have to do it by looking. The more pictures you have, the more you have to look.&#10;Source: Your Camera Roll Contains a Masterpiece | The New Yorker â†’ https://t.co/UAg0IqikkV&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I have been very keen on listening to Audiobooks recently. The moment I have some spare time, I am listening to the audiobooks. That does not bode well for my other interests. I also blame the brilliant collection of books I have been recommendedðŸ™ƒ.&#10;&#10;</description>
