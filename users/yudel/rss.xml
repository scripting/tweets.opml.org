			<description>@maimonides_nutz I don’t see why not. There are ways to mitigate your exposure. Perhaps Google for suggestions shy of her going cold turkey, but there are ample ways to reduce the smoke levels.&#10;&#10;@maimonides_nutz https://t.co/1t3rtD3x6Z&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I love designing book covers. I don't love doing it alone. So here's an invitation for feedback at a very early stage. https://t.co/hckOA1AmEL&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yes, Satmar prioritizes the abuser over the abused. Hard to imagine why a group that believes in an unaccountable, all-powerful deity mediated by unaccountable clergy would favor an abuse over his young female victims. https://t.co/wvoPy0ETHq&#10;&#10;Tell me again how monotheism makes people better, and is a “Jewish contribution to civilization?”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Not unrelated to the question of regulating of social media giants, I just had a very unpleasant experience with @instagram. https://t.co/HhCsYaXWXb&#10;&#10;@instagram I've made perhaps half a dozen posts on IG; I guess none in the past 30 days, if Meta, a company that has lied to Congress and the courts, is telling the truth.&#10;&#10;I've received no notices from IG on what pieces of their Terms of Service I am accused of violating, which is why I did not appeal in the putative 30 days.&#10;&#10;However: If I were to tell an unhappy client or vendor that I was no longer dealing with them, because they had violated the contract, but I refused to say how -- well, that would be problematic.&#10;&#10;If I stopped hosting a client's web site because they had 'violated the contract' and then refused to tell them what piece of the contract they had violated -- well, I would imagine there would be consequences.&#10;&#10;And if I told a judge that they violated terms with their content, which I had since deleted and had no record of -- well, that judge wouldn't have to deliberate very hard.&#10;&#10;And if I told the judge that I had relied on an automated pornography monitoring program in decreeing the contract terminated and applied no personal judgement -- well, that might be seen as being irresponsible.&#10;&#10;So: The question is whether I have a cause of action.&#10;&#10;Thanks to Texas Republican granny-killer Governor Greg Abbott, I actually do.&#10;&#10;Given that *everything* I posted was designed to express a Jewish viewpoint, if there was any actual content moderation decision made in my cancellation, then it was viewpoint discrimination.&#10;&#10;So: Is there anybody in Texas who might have an interest in the @BenYehudaPress IG content, please contact me.&#10;&#10;@BenYehudaPress Meta's failure to provide a transparent process of account cancelation is ultimately a scandal of unaccountable monopolies.&#10;&#10;Having an account with Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, or Amazon, actually is a valuable thing. Corporation shouldn't be able to deprive people of valuable things without due process.&#10;&#10;Anyway, my DMs are open if anyone wants to have fun in a Texas court.&#10;&#10;Shoutout to @AkivaMCohen and @mjs_DC who have been a very useful legal education the past year or so, and are *by no means* responsible for the content of this thread.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rmneiss @kampeas Agudah has fewer funders who are major Republican activists.&#10;I'm pretty sure Bernie Marcus, who helped launch the now neo-Nazi TP*SA, is a major federation guy.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Howard_Lovy If this book has a strong focus on the Newark piece of the fight, I might be interested in writing about it for the New Jersey Jewish News.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>We need to talk more about why gun proliferation is Republican dogma. And how the Buffalo white supremacist terror attack is a feature, not a bug, in their Second Anendment jurisprudence. https://t.co/wN3dErW4Ps&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Plutor @rob_sheridan @RottenInDenmark Yes. They have assignment editors, who want these articles and probably mostly agree with them. And they have copy editors, who may well be rolling their eyes as they smooth out the prose and add the hyperlinks.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics You know, if I’m an advertiser, I want to know number of users accessing tweets directly, through the app or the web, not via tweetdeck or the API.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics The fact that figure is apparently not footnoted in SEC filings speaks to Twitter’s failures in the advertising business.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@WbtphdjdTurner @roeeorland @West_Looper @mmasnick @ataxiwardance Constitutional is what Alito says is constitutional. The current SCOTUS has explicitly and implicitly renounced the idea of precedent.&#10;&#10;@WbtphdjdTurner @roeeorland @West_Looper @mmasnick @ataxiwardance My guess is that the law will be overturned, and that SCOTUS will issue a stay, but either on federalism grounds (regulating interstate commerce) or groundlessly on the Shadow Docket.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Shmarya @jh_swanson So like US cops. The point is not to enforce the law; the point is to enforce the power disparity.&#10;&#10;@Shmarya @jh_swanson That’s why they let crime run rampant in the Arab sector, while attacking legal Palestinian  political expression.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@johnpavlovitz They’ve been re-educated. Listen to three hours of propaganda daily, how could you not be convinced? It’s not like the other side is offering a counter argument.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Seggitorial @trekonomics Note that AIPAC does not consider spreading the Great Replacement Theory a deal-breaker when they donate to candidates. Unlike being a traitor to the Republican Party Line; they wouldn’t donate to staunchly pro-Israel Lynn Cheney until they were embarrassed by the public outcry.&#10;&#10;@Seggitorial @trekonomics A few thousand Jewish Bernie supporters dropped into the Pacific Ocean is a small price to pay to protect low capital gains rates, ammirite?&#10;&#10;</description>
