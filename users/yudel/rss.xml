			<description>@DBashIdeas Which my one-time Zohar hevrusa @kavvanah of course read and passed on to me.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DBashIdeas You'd have to look at the way &quot;The Zohar&quot; is in part the creation of the printer who first collected the Aramaic manuscripts, some of which had circulated separately.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas And the way that printing enabled a book that proclaimed to be holy but was not already considered authoritative to circulate widely -- and thereby be accepted and become canon.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas How much did the steadily declining price of print enable the spread of Chassidus in the 18th century?&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas Would the Baal Hatanya had written his own Shulchan Aruch, which spoke on behalf of a small portion of the Ashkenazic community, if printing costs were what they had been in the time of the Shulchan Aruch and the Rama, who between two of the wrote down the halacha for all Jewry?&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas Obviously, the Haskala was a product of print, like the Renaissance which inspired it.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas In the 20th century, someone reinvested money made selling lead dreidels on the Lower East Side to buy a printing press and founded Ktav.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas The development of computer-based phototypesetting meant that ArtScroll could start doing pre-Mac proto-desktop publishing for a relative pittance -- and once they bought that for invitations, why not write a commentary on Megilat Esther?&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas It shouldn't be too hard to find the costs of typesetting a volume of the Soncino Tanakh in the 40s versus an Artscroll volume in the 80s.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas My @BenYehudaPress only exists because of cheaper printing technology. The spark was my discovery of the availability of Print on Demand technology coupled with widespread distribution.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress I don't need to sell 5,000 copies to justify printing costs, and I don't have to warehouse 5,000 copies until they all sell.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress Going back a generation, it's hard to believe that the ability of everyone in the YU beis medresh to have a $20 photo offset set of Shas didn't have any affect on what was learned and taught.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress Were there shiurim that dealt with a list of sources that would be unfeasible to demand of students in Volozhin? Certainly a topic for investigation.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress The final chapter of the book describes Sefaria, its founding, its funding, and its acquisition of the Steinsaltz translation of Shas. I'm very much looking forward to the repercussions of that act in the decades ahead.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics So my NJ neighbor is currently at 27 on Amazon after less than a week. I once could translate that to sales but no longer can. Figures recalculate hourly so it’s selling steadily.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics It’s offering deeper knowledge to people who believe history is determined by personalities rather than systems and processes. Which is how Americans are generally taught to understand history.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics They are also taught to be dispassionate about history. I can’t imagine writing a “sexy” book about Trump that doesn’t rely on either black humor or moral outrage to make readers turn pages essentially about inter office memos.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics Here’s the “real” people behind the Dior basically uses porn to keep the pages turning.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics But the motive of the purchasers is a noble one.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics Disclaimer: I have so far succeeded in avoiding reading anything about the book and intend to continue so until final sales are revealed at the time of remaindering.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@froomkin The Sulzbergers are probably the most liberal people in their social circle. And the execs who buy ads are probably not liberal.&#10;&#10;@froomkin They can’t alienate the half of the age-and-wealth demographic that identify as Republican.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ljordanplatt @froomkin I’m happy you’re telling them that!&#10;&#10;@ljordanplatt @froomkin But even more importantly, whatever the owner’s politics, they don’t want to anger threat Republicans in their own social circle, among their advertisers, and their subscribers.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@HeerJeet Military “respect the gun” discipline is real an effective. I got a bit second hand from my dad. It won’t stop the killer with a rifle, perhaps, but would prevent all the kids killed in handgun “accidents.”&#10;&#10;@HeerJeet I suspect that most military veterans with kids are horrified by this picture. https://t.co/c9soB9lXtf&#10;&#10;</description>
