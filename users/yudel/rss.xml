			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today -- Wednesday, June 27 -- marks the 366th anniversary of Baruch Spinoza’s excommunication by the Amsterdam Jewish community. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/pGjAXcFIes&quot;&gt;https://t.co/pGjAXcFIes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But what if, instead of finding deep theological questions that undermined traditional Jewish belief, the 23-year-old had found true love in the person of a young widow from a Lithuanian shtetl?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;To find out what might have happened, you&amp;#39;ll have to read of “A Face That Launched a Thousand Ships,” a story by Milton Verskin slated to appear in “Other Covenants: Alternate Histories of the Jewish People.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/AZ9807VKSg&quot;&gt;https://t.co/AZ9807VKSg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Which is your reminder: If you haven&amp;#39;t yet pledged for a copy of Other Covenants on Kickstarter, time is running out! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/EsaEUeqFp0&quot;&gt;https://t.co/EsaEUeqFp0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah Yes, but: I think it&amp;#39;s more than about hiding a problem. I think it&amp;#39;s about a deeply ingrained belief that only bad people do bad things, so bad-doers don&amp;#39;t have to be treated like people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah And that bad things only happen to bad people, so people who claim to be victims are in fat bad and don&amp;#39;t have to be treated like people.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah There is an unspoken essentialism akin to the worst manifestations of the Esaf soneh at Yaakov trope.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah Which is why American policing can resemble the IDF policing of the Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah And those who call for systemic change -- whether of policing, punishment, health services, or housing -- are greeted with the same unspoken disdain with which mainstream Israel treats advocates for Palestinians.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah This is particularly true if those calling for such change do not look like people considered as authority figures when one was growing up -- or if they with those who associate with those who don&amp;#39;t pass that 1940s or 50s litmus test.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah This is my current monocausal explanation of why the Democratic gerontocracy is flailing the way it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AkivaMCohen He may or may not honestly not know how to read a p factor. He knows his audience certainly can’t. (No shame there; I can’t really either, but I at least know my limitations.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AkivaMCohen But the question returns to my pinned tweet: Why have some people decided that spreading pro-virus propaganda is a good way to spend one’s life?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah And this is a large part of why people kvetch about trivial matters like kitniyos and chicken. Avoiding pork and oysters means trusting the Torah. Avoiding cheeseburgers means trusting all the Tanaim.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah Chicken and kitniyot means choosing some rabbis over other rabbis. And the community’s mechanism for choosing which rabbis to listen to is pretty broken.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah Maybe it always was, but now everyone can see it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bruces Did you see the reports out of Israel last week on the lifting of censorship on their autonomous drone program which dated back to the 90s?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bruces Apparently it was a major investment designed to defend against a Syrian invasion if a return of the Golan Heights was negotiated, as seemed possible at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bruces The drones were repurposed to take out Hamas activists in the 2000 intifada, which resulted in the irony of Gazans seeing deadly drones which Israeli media couldn’t report.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bruces Which brings to mind this 1973 Doonesbury cartoon.  ￼ ￼ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/48F55HxPfL&quot;&gt;https://t.co/48F55HxPfL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@DandiaAsad “Will” is a very generous assumption here.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DandiaAsad I’d like to think this is all an elaborate publicity stunt on behalf of @lavietidhar’s forthcoming novel. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/OdQMbivCGE&quot;&gt;https://t.co/OdQMbivCGE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DandiaAsad @lavietidhar The more frightening possibility is that MBS is loudly advertising his deep gullibility and griftability.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
