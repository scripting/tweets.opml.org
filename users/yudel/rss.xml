			<description>@onthemainline One Seder I offered four explanations for the orange on our plate. One was a Zionist reference to Jaffa oranges. One was this historically accurate explanation. One drew on Tu b’shvat klipa ideas. Can’t remember the fourth at the moment. Maybe a glass of wine would help…&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Yair_Rosenberg I think you underestimate the challenges involved in asking her “at the outset to account for her anti-Semitic utterances. These questions should be posed in specific and concrete terms, making explicit reference to the ugly ideas she has written and recommended.”&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg I would imagine that she has retyped more (out of context) Talmud citations than most newspaper culture reporters have ever read.&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg Do you quote and then call @FoxmanAbraham for a rebuttal? And now you’ve both-sided the Protocols.&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg @FoxmanAbraham Do you simply say, Walker, who holds bizarre antisemitic conspiracy theories, as an appositive clause as if it were an honorary degree or a lingering illness?&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg @FoxmanAbraham The journalistic conventions of approaching every main character with a presumption of good faith makes de facto cancellation the easiest course for a reporter and editor for whom an Alice Walker appearance is supposed to be an easy story.&#10;&#10;</description>
