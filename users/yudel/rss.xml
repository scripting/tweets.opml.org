			<description>@rmneiss Our local federation is on board with the OU. Which accepts Schecters as well as Catholic and Muslim schools under its lobbying umbrella.&#10;&#10;@rmneiss But here the OU is leading the way. Of course, the budgets of Bergen County day schools dwarf the federation budget.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rmneiss I expect the Supreme Court will legalize direct funding of parochial schools shortly. As it is, the OU is boasting of a billion dollars in state aid to Jewish schools in the past decade.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EladNehorai I mean, he’s not wrong. What he ignores is that most people are low level narcisstic jerks at the best of times.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai I imagine if I were less of a narcisstic jerk, I’d still be married.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai The problem is that halacha empowers the narcisstic jerk.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai I imagine that most murders are committed by narcissistic jerks. I imagine there would be a lot more if there were no real consequences for murder.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@PetreRaleigh @RottenInDenmark @deonteleologist I mean, here we have them recruiting a slaveholder to defend the U. S. from charges of racism. George Washington had his virtues, but non-racism wasn’t one of them. https://t.co/2nojuwEK73&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AkivaMCohen Probably less offensive than their whitewashing of Christopher Columbus. Say what you want about Washington — and even Jefferson — but they didn’t murder children and feed them to their parents.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen The idea that a Jew would whitewash a man so hideous that Ferdinand and Isabella found him sanctionably cruel to heathens is mind boggling.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Shortly before Moetzes Gedolei Torah realized that ploughing through the Talmud every seven years was ultimately a cheaper distraction than feeding their crossword puzzle addiction. https://t.co/5ekxGLNjzW&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@RottenInDenmark @deonteleologist But he accepts the Republican idea that “racism” is only explicit racial discrimination or *false* judgements based on race. And he thinks his phrenology consists of *true* judgements so is not racist.&#10;&#10;@RottenInDenmark @deonteleologist My Beloved Conservative Relative who believed all the Obama conspiracy theories couldn’t understand why his liberal friends considered him racist. He was really hurt and puzzled by that.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@azforeman I have always wondered why Amtrak doesn’t have a Saint Louis stop between DC and Norfolk.&#10;&#10;@azforeman Also, I like how the Mediterranean tunnel departs from Jerusalem, where lesser engineers might have chosen Tel Aviv.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@MisfitTorah That’s why they preemptively invested in calling her dumb. Because she might convince their followers that they’re being played for suckers.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EladNehorai And they weren’t in communist societies?&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai There will always be humans who abuse power. The question is how can you create structures that minimize that.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai Conversely, any organization based on an ideal is particularly prone to ignore the need for such structures in the name of malarkey such as “socialists will act socially” or “the Invisible Hand will provide” or “Torah scholars have conquered their yetzer.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It is possible that I saw the Gumby episode cited here when it first aired. I was four at the time and I loved Gumby. https://t.co/bqiFaCojGy&#10;&#10;If so, it might had been my first exposure to typesetting equipment and computer keyboards. (My dad had a typewriter, and would occasionally bring home surplus  punch cards from his dissertation work, which was a FORTRAN linear programming project.)&#10;&#10;One wonders about the impact of shows watched and forgotten in childhood.&#10;&#10;</description>
