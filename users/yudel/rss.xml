			<description>&lt;p&gt;@EladNehorai Here in the Forward. From Livingston, making her pro-bagel and Jewish adjacent, but apparently not appropriate for profiling in the NJ @JewishStandard &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/NXgQFTYU10&quot;&gt;https://t.co/NXgQFTYU10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Instead of Longtermism, we need Zeydeism — how can we make the best future for our grandchildren and their peers 75 years hence?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics The flip side is that the whole enlightenment project of working toward a better future is only three or four centuries old. So the potential for improvement in the next century is actually rather big.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Well, African rates are trending down too. The hubris is thinking that that we are better positioned to solve the problems of a century hence than our descendants are.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics One of the dangers of overvaluing the unborn, so a planet which settles into a stable 7 billion people is worse than one that settles at 10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@protecttruth_ I would say this is good news. “Rogue courts want to arm Texas teens against will of Republican legislature” is a better slogan than “Rogue Court wants to disempower the EPA”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@nberlat People are not used to the fine print making govt policies look &lt;em&gt;better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@nberlat Starting to think the administration is legit playing chess these days, against Team R who can barely manage checkers.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@nberlat Note that unlike most efforts at “centrism,” the administration accepts the left frame that student debt is unfair and is sniping at the right.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Thinking about the loan forgiveness rollout. They leaked the $10k amount well in advance — front loading complaints it wasn’t enough. They buried more consequential relief in the fine print. And now they’re dunking on their Republican critics — not on the left.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I think they’ve deliberately moved the Overton Window to the left.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;That’s not something I recall much of from recent Dem administrations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;“I was afraid that my daughter would grow up in a school that is a kind of ghetto, only for asylum seekers,” Marhtsion explains. “I asked myself – why shouldn’t my daughter study together with other Israeli children?” &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/LRM3yKLUVW&quot;&gt;https://t.co/LRM3yKLUVW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“I am a believing Christian, and when I studied in college I organized joint prayers for women, even though such prayers were prohibited by law.” — One can see why the Israeli government wouldn’t want people like her. Christians are one thing; woman’s prayer groups are treif.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“It hurts me to leave,” she repeats, “I got to know the Israelis deeply. Most of the public wants us and lives with us in peace, but because of politicians and a handful of racists, our lives look the terrible way they do.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;(It’s worth noting the ways the institutions of the American Jewish community prioritize relations with the politicians, rather than the people.)&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“The people I met where I worked always took care of me and helped me grow. It pains me that I couldn’t continue living in Israel, but it’s a shame that the country, with all its history, closes its heart to refugees.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
