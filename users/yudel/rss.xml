			<description>@TfTHacker Two others I would add: PCOutline, which stood outlining from @davewiner and memory residence (remember that?!) from Sidekick. I lived in that for several years.&#10;&#10;@TfTHacker @davewiner Now, I use the primitive @NotionHQ outline features as part of relying on Notion to keep track of my myriad tasks and sub tasks. It’s not perfect, but the Kanban view is indispensable.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TfTHacker Died because MS announced that it would bundle Outlook with its next iteration of Office.&#10;&#10;@TfTHacker There are people still using it. (I only stopped using it regularly when I started using Workflowy in 2017.)&#10;&#10;@TfTHacker There is an amazing story to be told of an anonymous programmer who created EccoExt, an extension that hooked into the machine code and added a large number of features,&#10;&#10;@TfTHacker ranging from mouse scroll support to Lua programmability.&#10;&#10;@TfTHacker Still a few posts every month on the Google Group.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@froomkin One of the Times’ financial responsibilities is to ensure that Republican in the owners social circle, Republican advertisers, and Republican subscribers don’t turn against the paper because it makes them feel bad. That is what drives the political coverage.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DrMarinaArcher @waltshaub Seems like there ought to be provisions for, “if you feel you must break the law and destroy records, please don’t hurt the plumbing by flushing them and please have a fire extinguisher if you’re going to burn them.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This may well be deeply concerning. But…. https://t.co/YjDYJyogqX&#10;&#10;One distressing fact in the present moment is that American governance is deeply broken by the Republican prioritization of waging war against the Democrats above everything else.&#10;&#10;The Atlantic recently reported that when Syria crossed Obama’s red line and used poison gas, Obama decided that waging was was a job for Congress and he approached McConnell — who declined to act.&#10;&#10;After all, why hand Obama a foreign policy win?&#10;&#10;As we’ve seen with the slow walking of approving key foreign policy posts, the Republicans are doing the minimum to support US foreign policy.&#10;&#10;(Note that they allowed a Republican to hold up Iron Dome aid, figuring that Israel supporters wouldn’t hold the party accountable, and they were right. As @rmneiss has documented, AIPAC spent ten times more attacking the Democrats who initially opposed the aid than&#10;&#10;the Republican who continued to object for several more months.)&#10;&#10;From the perspective of Joe Biden, foreign policy as usual saves him from Republican criticism. And they, for better or worse, seems to be a major goal of his.&#10;&#10;If the Iran deal falls apart, that will be why. Unlike Obama, who was an idealist, Biden will be making a political decision. I think Obama was legit scared by Bibi into seeking the deal — much to Bibi’s chagrin, of course.&#10;&#10;Faced with the mental image of nuked Israelis, Obama was willing to spend political capital to slow Iran’s drive to the bomb. Biden is not.&#10;&#10;Frankly, I can’t say I blame him.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@allshiny Hmmm. A possible recommendation for us guilty carnivores. (Or non-practicing vegetarians, as we prefer to call ourselves.) if I may ask: How old were you when you stopped eating meat?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AD_Lobel I would not travel with that man, who clearly does not know how to hire qualified people. Though really, preferring to communicate by snailmail is a red flag, as I tell people who don’t want to submit doc or pdf files.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@evawyner @kampeas Lot of people loved President Obama, but so few renamed their school after him…. :-)&#10;&#10;@evawyner @kampeas I went to Cleveland’s Agnon School, which was also renamed, so I share in the alumni outrage over the renaming.&#10;&#10;</description>
