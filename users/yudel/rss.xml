			<description>@jh_swanson @Shmarya Maybe because the umbrella organization of American Muslim organizations doesn’t have an unrepentant Republican apparatchik as its CEO?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@froomkin @JeffBezos Radical billionaire “centrism” is an ideological choice, perhaps the only one consistent with the idea of a “non-partisan” and “non-ideological” forum of ideas.&#10;&#10;@froomkin @JeffBezos You can’t support even Democrats like Biden, because at their core they’re partisan New Dealers, and you can’t support Republicans because they’re hateful fascists. Both sides indeed.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@joshtpm In 77, Rabin stayed on as PM of his caretaker government even after bowing out of the election because of his bank account scandal. Of course, that didn’t work out well for his party.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If I remember correctly, Rabin’s first government fell in the wake of an education minister’s resignation. This led to the election of Menachem Begin.&#10;&#10;Who despite campaigning as a Remainer was responsible for — how do you say it — Sexit.&#10;&#10;I remembered wrong. Zevulun Hammer resigned as Welfare Minister. He became Education Minister under Begin as a reward. https://t.co/ZP7K204U9b&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@acandidworld @schraubd I still haven’t heard a compelling explanation of why AIPAC decided this was the election cycle to start funding candidates.&#10;&#10;@acandidworld @schraubd Seems like the most polarizing US election in over a century might not be the year to start dropping bundles of money wrapped in an Israeli flag on political campaigns.&#10;&#10;@acandidworld @schraubd I mean, a cynic might think that a Republican-leaning group felt that Republicans could use a new and loud endorsement at a time like this.&#10;&#10;@acandidworld @schraubd A cynic might wonder whether the unknown folks at AIPAC who decided on this course are more loyal to the interests of the Republican Party or to the State of Israel.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dzkalman There are very few lines of communication between “younger” generations and the “leadership” cadres. Half go to Murdoch to find out what’s going on in the world; half go to the Times.&#10;&#10;@dzkalman And there is a very strong interest — which has multiple causes — in not attributing any blame for rising antisemitism to mainstream Republican culture, including Fox and Trump.&#10;&#10;@dzkalman The community is deeply broken and the press is effectively muzzled.&#10;&#10;@dzkalman Who in the business can call up a billionaire such as Bernie Marcus and say, “Now that the Republican youth group you helped fund is posting racist, antisemitic Nazi memes, do you have any second thoughts?”&#10;&#10;@dzkalman The charitable view is that leaders realize there’s no actually stopping hate and so have given up, and after all we can all flee to Israel so why bother.&#10;&#10;@dzkalman That would explain why the ADL web site has plans with fancy acronyms but doesn’t actually link to the legislation it supports.&#10;&#10;@dzkalman That might also explain the apparent lack of interest in debriefing convicted antisemitic criminals.&#10;&#10;@dzkalman And that would also explain why my congressman can weaponize false charges of antisemitism against Jewish political opponents on his left.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ehnyay @EladNehorai It can’t afford to use high caliber reporting, because like the NYTimes and the Atlantic, it wants to appear “nonpartisan.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics One of the downsides of being ruled by people who came of age before the acceptance of plate tectonics.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics I mean, how seriously was geology treated at a Catholic high school circa 1960?&#10;&#10;@trekonomics At least students at the Talmudic Institute of Upstate New York had statewide standardized tests to aspire to, if one was so inclined. Did Delaware?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DandiaAsad @JPoetryProject Please! The cover picture was photoshopped and does not reflect an actual Coney Island venue.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DandiaAsad Okay, the first book of poetry @JPoetryProject published features Coney Island on one of its cover. The author has passed on, but if I wanted to hold a Jewish poetry reading there, is there a potential venue I could reach out to?&#10;&#10;@DandiaAsad @JPoetryProject https://t.co/i2SLFi2Nek&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EladNehorai Here’s the thing. If the violence reflects a background antisemitism but doesn’t explicitly make it an ideology, that *increases* the responsibility of those who foster the background noise of racism and antisemitism.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai But if that’s the case, blame can’t be placed solely on the internet subculture, but on the wider post 2016 culture.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai But — and it’s a big but — it’s unseemly and impossible for NPR to pin any blame on the Republican Party.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai The subculture can focus on accelerationism because Tucker Carlson et al provide the basic principles.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai As always, with great power comes great ability to get away with great crime.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@elivalley Hard to believe that a movement which has as a leading spokesman someone who said God demands that thoughtful non-Orthodox Jews be “hated like vermin” could fall so low.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jh_swanson @RokhlK He’s just following in the footsteps of Mark Levin, Dennis Prager, Whatshisnane Horowitz, and Ben Shapiro. It’s a very good grift. And he will definitely outlive his fellow yidden who precede him to the ovens.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@jamesdnicoll @hammard_1987 If slide rules were good enough for Podkayne of Mars….&#10;&#10;@jamesdnicoll @hammard_1987 Though the first whoah! moment in my recent reread was the opening scene, in which the entire action is prompted by the teenager roaming the halls because the magazines in the waiting room were boring.&#10;&#10;@jamesdnicoll @hammard_1987 Give Podkayne an iPhone to text her friends or watch TikTok and the whole plot would have been aborted.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>If the Republicans hadn’t decided to oppose the assault weapon ban, this child would not be an orphan. https://t.co/uONLNrrPpK&#10;&#10;Maybe it’s time to question whether unapologetic Republican apparatchiks should have a place in polite Jewish society.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@LemieuxLGM Interesting. I definitely bought into this — I didn’t feel the 2000 election mattered much. Probably most of my news consumption at that point was still the NYTimes; I had let my old New Republic subscription lapse.&#10;&#10;@LemieuxLGM It took Paul Krugman and the liberal blogosphere to radicalize me. But as Krugman repeatedly noted, his distress over Bush was rooted in reading his publicly available plans.&#10;&#10;</description>
