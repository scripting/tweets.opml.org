			<description>@smallbeerpress Not we. This is wholly on Biden, Schumer and Pelosi. And their inability to accept that Congress has an objectively pro-covid faction.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>A couple plausible argument that three Republican governors killed 40,000 Americans with their pro-covid policies. That’s more than 10 9/11s, if you’re wondering how outraged you should be. https://t.co/6ttmd3lMOm&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@whstancil It’s also been a huge part of Republican messaging which is a huge driver of public opinion on all things.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>To paraphrase a Joan Didion interviewee: If Holocaust museums are going to fete George W. Bush and ignore his illegal torture regime, what's even the point of having had a Holocaust?&#10;https://t.co/7yqVsjH6w6&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dylanotes They openly admit it? Mostly, nobody seems to be asking what their alternative plan for for denuclearizing Iran given the evident failure of the Bibi/Trump approach @Daroff et al advocate.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Why is my senator “calling” on the Senate to pass a bill, rather than, say, calling out a specific senator, say Rubio, for opposing the bill? https://t.co/mTiYkoLx7u&#10;&#10;Maybe hold a Spanish-language press conference in Florida with a local Democratic politician or two?&#10;&#10;Yes, he needs the Lakewood votes too. But calling on the Senate just highlights how worthless the Democratic majority is. Stop whining and fight.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Mike_Hixenbaugh @swordsjew Seems like (accurately) demonizing Republicans as anti-vaxxers might have worked among this heavily vaxxed demographic.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I don’t think we talk enough about Jerry Herman’s pre-&quot;Hello Dolly&quot;, pre-&quot;Mame&quot; musical “Milk and Honey.” Back when I was young and irresponsible, I downloaded the soundtrack via Napster, and it always surprises when it surfaces on random play. https://t.co/imEa7XojCh&#10;&#10;(Note: Do not confuse it with the John Lennon / Yoko Ono album of the same name. Though &quot;Nobody Told Me There Would Be Days Like These&quot; could make a great aliyah anthem.) https://t.co/QNhrp6F6IO&#10;&#10;Quoth Wikipedia: &quot;Herman ... was approached by theatre producer Gerard Oestreicher, who was seeking a composer for a project about Israel he hoped to mount on Broadway. He sent Herman and Appell there to absorb the culture and hopefully find inspiration.&quot; https://t.co/4tH4lIc0t4 https://t.co/jg9aybz0JC&#10;&#10;Wikipedia: Herman was determined that the musical not be a patriotic love letter. Herman said: “We were there to soak up the atmosphere...Once we saw this group of little old lady tourists rummaging about, we knew that they had to be in our show.”&#10;&#10;Wikipedia quotes Herman: &quot;Everything about this place is not perfect. I had already written the song called &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; as a kind of an anthem, and I said, ... 'I have to have another point of view.' https://t.co/z5JzSoj4Sw&#10;&#10;Herman: &quot;And I wrote the counterpoint after I wrote the first song — 'the honey's kind of bitter and the milk's a little sour...' That made it real for me.&quot;&#10;&#10;Ah, those halcyon days when one could write a song about &quot;shalom&quot; meaning both &quot;goodbye&quot; and &quot;hello&quot; without thinking about &quot;Shalom chaver&quot; and whether Yigal Amir has a place in an Israeli staging of Assassins.  https://t.co/gP2h0ay3t7&#10;&#10;The results: &quot;It enjoyed a solid run of 543 performances at Broadway’s Martin Beck Theatre. The musical opened to mostly favorable reviews and was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Herman’s score, Molly Picon’s performance, and for Best Musical.&quot; https://t.co/5ggXUDcTSX&#10;&#10;No doubt, the failure of Mad Magazine to parody it hurt its place in the cannon. It's obvious why the very Jewish &quot;usual gang of idiots&quot; shied away. Maybe it's time for @elivalley to give it a shot? https://t.co/t7Rb439bcE&#10;&#10;I'll wrap up by pointing to an even less-known Jewish musical, &quot;A Talmud Tale,&quot; created by the late, great Rabbi Judith Abrams with generous funding from the @covenantfn. The premise: &quot;Rachel’s bat mitzvah is nearing, and fights with her mother are heating up.....&#10;&#10;&quot;Will the ceremony marking Rachel’s coming of age instead tear apart her family? Assistance comes from an unlikely source: a friendly time-traveling angel who transports Rachel nearly 2,000 years to the ancient world of Talmudic Israel.&#10;&#10;&quot;There, a classic story of love and parental disapproval plays out between Rachel’s ancient namesake and a poor shepherd, Akiva. In the end, Rachel discovers that the ancient Talmud has some very practical lessons for a modern girl.&quot;&#10;&#10;You can watch it a series of YouTube videos of its staged performance in Houston..... https://t.co/e9Jq9QYga8&#10;&#10;... or you can order a copy of the script from @benyehudapress.  https://t.co/P8oZ2WcbRG&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Very true, but also true on every other single issue. We are long past the point where bipartisanship should be seen as a real virtue rather than something akin to   1930s pacifism of Edith Keeler z&quot;l. https://t.co/ubrus3Aa4E&#10;&#10;</description>
