			<description>@davewiner They value their relationships with Republicans (who are their owner’s social circle and their advertisers) more than they value our trust.</description>

			<description>@schwarz His neuroscience claims seem to be at least 20 years premature. Not a neuroscientist myself, but a family member is a postdoc and her research which is being published in a top journal is a long way from what EM’s researcher is promising.</description>

			<description>The Constitutional regime the Republican Barrett SCOTUS is teeing up will grant the Executive unlimited powers as Commander in Chief but no ability to be delegated Congressional authority for the General Welfare.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Yd2PD07qgk&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics Both played a role in Altered Carbon, a very fun but fairly amoral noir cyberpunk novel that probably influenced him far more than did the KSR Mars trilogy.</description>

			<description>@dsquareddigest For what it’s worth, my two cents on military/foreign policy, as someone who is very much not focused on the field: 1) Before the Iraq War, I assumed the Bushies advocating it knew what they were doing, because military/foreign policy was their bailiwick. Fool me once…</description>

			<description>@dsquareddigest 2) After we effectively lost the war waged in Afghanistan on a bipartisan basis, there has been absolutely no effort by Congress to figure out what we did wrong. Apparently, while funding the military is a bipartisan priority, neither party can be bothered to ensure it works.</description>

			<description>@dsquareddigest Having read a grand total of one book on the military I’m certainly no expert, but that book compelling argued that the US Army, like many an enterprise, works to maximize the goals of each decision maker, rather than the professed corporate mission.</description>

			<description>@dsquareddigest “The Perfect War” argues that body counts served the goals of war planners who wanted a metric, and killing civilians to inflate the body count served the goals of officers who were judged by that metric. It did not, however, actually help win the war. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/s84D7d99yU&quot;&gt;[link]&lt;/a&gt;</description>

			<description>@dsquareddigest The fact that Congress is incapable of addressing this, whether because of capture by defense contractors or general stupidity or whatever, is deeply disturbing to me both as a taxpayer and as someone who doesn’t want to live under foreign occupation as described by @Ww3Real.</description>

			<description>@Inkling61 @jayrosen_nyu They knew that their business model of providing news reporting wouldn't make Republicans gag wasn't compatible with the journalistic standards a Public Editor would hold them to, certainly not once the Republican party embraced Trump.</description>
