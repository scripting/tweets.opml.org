			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah @yaeltime I think it’s a response to the Evangelical myth that Christianity was a bulwark against Naziism and is never an oppressor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah @yaeltime See for example this critique of a Bonhoeffer biography, which argues that the Evangelical biographer distorted the anti-Nazi theologian to make him a good Christian by Southern Baptist standards. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/eDTBHMZeQA&quot;&gt;https://t.co/eDTBHMZeQA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Since I worry about this — it seems the FBI is actually good about returning your phone to you rather quickly if you don’t give them a hard time about cloning it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Nonetheless, I recently backed up key numbers so I can contact loved ones if I need to resort to a temporary phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Also, I make it a point not to conspire to commit federal crimes. Nobody else’s plan is worth even a day away from beloved iPhone 13 mini.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@yaeltime @ElishevaAvital Where it will be swallowed by a fish. Who will be caught by a fisherman and served as a Shabbos delicacy in Monsey. Wherein the smartphone will be discovered, turned on, and quickly corrupt a wonderful heimische family. Do you really want that on your conscience as YK approaches?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Glad to help. And offer my Twitter addiction as a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Did you have screen time rules last year? Do the hours gradually increase as the child approaches age 21?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck If so, full abolition is unfair to both their past and future selves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Additionally, conflict and adversity builds character. Does your child want to be like the proverbial Tzaddik of Newark, who used to confuse the yetzer hara by giving in without a struggle but — crucially — was doomed to live in Newark?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck You could remind them that Roman children had no limitations on screen time but conversely could be sold not slavery by their parents. Is that what they want?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Let&amp;#39;s see. A quick google says His height is 236,000 parasangs, each being 3 miles. Roughly, that&amp;#39;s 600k miles to a 6&amp;#39; foot tall man, or a ratio of 100k X 5.286k or (again roughly) a scale of 500 million to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson A book cover is a roughly 2 decimeters, 200m nanometers. Which means one book cover&amp;#39;s worth of God&amp;#39;s Supernal Body is about half a nanometer of a human.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Which seems to be about five hydrogen atoms lined up, so presumably a moderately complex protein or two. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lwhJ5WEt7u&quot;&gt;https://t.co/lwhJ5WEt7u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Hmmm....&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah To be fair to YU, I felt the same as a straight student back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah One of the most important lessons I learned at Yeshiva College is that Institutions act neither for the good of the ostensible human constituents, or toward their stated values, but for their self preservation and aggrandizement. An important but painful lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
