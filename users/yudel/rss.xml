			<description>@aayushkrm @hardmaru I suspect that by 2035 that a computer can both write a script from a prompt and then generate the photorealistic movie.&#10;&#10;@aayushkrm @hardmaru Whether it will be a good script is a different question.&#10;&#10;@aayushkrm @hardmaru And how cheap it all is to generate.&#10;&#10;@aayushkrm @hardmaru Will it be able to generate a situation comedy or action adventure movie based on my prompting my obscure interest?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@onthemainline @abesilbe @rabbimargulies @MisfitTorah Certainly that’s normative psak regarding the Czar. Didn’t the Vatican only mattir democracy circa 1890?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@abesilbe @rabbimargulies @MisfitTorah Yes. Kahane was theologically wrong. (His sociological insights are more mixed.) What Kahane gave me at that point of time was an English-language theology that explained the actions of Gush Emunim.&#10;&#10;@abesilbe @rabbimargulies @MisfitTorah That was helpful in my personal political journey, because while I was not qualified then to discuss security issues raised by the settlers and their supporters, I was qualified to dismiss Kahane’s theology.&#10;&#10;@abesilbe @rabbimargulies @MisfitTorah And as to the critique of my invoking Kahane: it’s important to understand when debating what is being contested.&#10;&#10;@abesilbe @rabbimargulies @MisfitTorah And back in my day at YU, a speech by Kahane on campus was much less problematic for the rabbinic faculty than was a talk by Rabbi Saul Berman, who was on the faculty of the school’s Stern College for Women but was an advocate for what now is called Open Orthodoxy.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@MisfitTorah Kahane has explained that such use of power is actually a kiddush Hashem. I think it’s in one of his 80s books. Worth reading to understand that this is a theological disagreement you’re having.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Everybody knows about Yeshiva Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchanan (aka YU's RIETS seminary) but who remembers the Elhanan Spektor Lodge of B'nai B'rith? https://t.co/RJI1kWu9Zd&#10;&#10;The October 29, 1897 issue of the the San Francisco Jewish publication currently known as J: The Jewish News of Northern California reports as follows: https://t.co/0xeYN1MTui&#10;&#10;A new B'nai B'rith Lodge, composed of Russian-born young men, is to be soon organized under the name of Elhanan Spektor Lodge. The name is well chosen. Elhanan Spektor, now gone to his reward, was in all respects the finest type of the scholar and Zaddig these years have produced https://t.co/bbtLVy7jgC&#10;&#10;Tolerant, just, pious and gentle, his virtues déserve commemoration amongst those of his countrymen who desire his name to be perpetuated on this side of the globe.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@gabrielwinant It’s an embodiment of a fascist Christian theology, that *assumes* an all-powerful being would harbor infinite resentment.&#10;&#10;@gabrielwinant Which turns greed (wanting to have been created sooner) and resentment (punishing those who had not helped him) into divine values.&#10;&#10;@gabrielwinant It’s Ayn Rand meets Fire and Brinstone. So prototypically American.&#10;&#10;@gabrielwinant The fact people take it seriously implies a profound lack of philosophical training among seemingly smart people.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EladNehorai If it’s any comfort, @instagram cancelled my seldom used, very lame @BenYehudaPress account for reasons they won’t deign to tell me because 30 days have expired and we all know how hard document retention is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Stupid, unappealable cancellation is really not viable. Speaking as such a victim.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Charge $25 for a review by a real person. That would pay for 15 minutes of a real person’s time to review the offending post in context.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Or charge $50 and refund half if the appeal is granted.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety But meanwhile he should file a complaint in Texas court.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety I’m actually considering notifying IG’s legal department of my intent to file. What *is* the Texas filing fee?&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety How much would a Waco attorney charge to file if I were to draft the papers?&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Happy to sign an affidavit that to the best of my recollection all my posts expressed the viewpoint that everyone should buy my Jewish books.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@alanabbey Looks familiar. Lax? EWR? Do all airports *except* BG look the same?&#10;&#10;@alanabbey Given that they’re collecting via PayPal, and PayPal notoriously is difficult for Palestinians to access, one has to question their authenticity.&#10;&#10;@alanabbey However, scamming Red Army supporters doesn’t bother me much so 🤷‍♂️&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas This was indeed a fun one.&#10;&#10;@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas What would be involved in creating supplemental volumes? Essential Papers on the Talmud from the Clinton Administration and After? (That volume is copyright ‘94.)&#10;&#10;@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas Anyone who knows one of the fields covered by that NYU series and would like to curate a volume, my dms are open!&#10;&#10;@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas Though I should probably start by asking Rabbi Chernick, whose Sunday morning Talmud shiur I was privileged to attend for several years.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dick_nixon Sir, I am sorry to say you were not loved by the eight year olds in my suburban private liberal Jewish school in advance of your re-election.&#10;&#10;@dick_nixon And that was without any of us knowing the, shall we say, unseemly conversation you had on my eighth birthday which was 6/23/72. Kind of scars a ten-year-old’s faith in authority to learn how a president, even one he despised, obstructed justice on his eighth birthday.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Area rabbi defends AIPAC funding insurrectionists. Let me know if you find it convincing. https://t.co/kZbaZ3vhl0&#10;&#10;Worth noting that for all his talk of supporting liberal causes, he does not seem to have submitted any op-eds to his local Jewish paper making the argument for BLM and the like.&#10;&#10;</description>
