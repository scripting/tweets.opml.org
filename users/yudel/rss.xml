			<description>&lt;p&gt;Your reminder that the NYTimes pays people to produce right wing disinformation, which generally works by highlighting a minor situation to obscure a major situation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hfjKycGNm2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/hfjKycGNm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that this works only because the NYTimes downplays right wing bad behavior. If Republican efforts in Virginia to sue book publishers and reverse decades of First Amendment law had been properly reported by the ‚Äúpaper of record,‚Äù the columnist couldn‚Äôt have ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And yes, there is a book that @BenYehudaPress hopes to publish in the next year or two which may be illegal to sell in certain states by then, given the Republican Supreme Court‚Äôs pledged goal of returning the Constitution to its 18th or 19th century reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm willing to gamble the minuscule advance I pay my authors that the #RogueSCOTUS will be right-sized before it rules on these matters and obligates Amazon to restrict sales of the book in Red States.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But if I were paying real money ‚Äî you better believe there‚Äôd be a chilling effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Ms. Paul‚Äôs job is not going explicitly not to tell you that Lolita and Origin of the Species could plausibly be banned in American states before the decade is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@JeffSharlet I wish there were some discussion of an off-ramp. A formal way for people to say, ‚ÄúI used to be a Republican, but I‚Äôm no longer aboard. I did not sign up sedition and banning birth control and putting gays back in the closet. For the conceivable future, I‚Äôm outta there‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@JeffSharlet Something I could give my kids to make the case to their grandfather. Who is really a much nicer person than the fascist politics he has drifted into quietly acceding to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the wonderful things of being of a certain age is that I have wonderful nostalgic childhood memories of typewriters which renew my deep appreciation for having moved past that technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4bI8foGDOP&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4bI8foGDOP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Likewise with programming with punch cards, only more so. Much more so, because the Fun Thing about punchcards is that there was no backspace key or Witeout. Make a mistake and you have to retype the card (a line of code) from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics One possible tell of cryotofascist religious apologetics/propaganda is the cargo cult usage of terms such as ‚Äúprogress‚Äù and ‚ÄúChristianity‚Äù without actually engaging with the facts and ideas they‚Äôre ostensibly pointing to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Is he calling for a return of sumptuary laws?

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the thing: the values of personal freedom and individual choice that let me decide to wear a yarmulke as an eighth grader in a public school are the same one that require me to accept people&amp;#39;s determination of their  gender and marriage partner. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/FFsxRfW7Gp&quot;&gt;https://t.co/FFsxRfW7Gp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Ben is basically arguing that &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; time, Christian supremacy is good for the Jews.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@scalzi @Sandhilldiary I&amp;#39;m so old, that I remember learning the phrase &amp;quot;politically correct&amp;quot; from someone who had picked it up as a recent undergrad, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it made its breakout into the rightwing mediasphere.
