			<description>&lt;p&gt;@yaeltime @ElishevaAvital Where it will be swallowed by a fish. Who will be caught by a fisherman and served as a Shabbos delicacy in Monsey. Wherein the smartphone will be discovered, turned on, and quickly corrupt a wonderful heimische family. Do you really want that on your conscience as YK approaches?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Glad to help. And offer my Twitter addiction as a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Did you have screen time rules last year? Do the hours gradually increase as the child approaches age 21?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck If so, full abolition is unfair to both their past and future selves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Additionally, conflict and adversity builds character. Does your child want to be like the proverbial Tzaddik of Newark, who used to confuse the yetzer hara by giving in without a struggle but — crucially — was doomed to live in Newark?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck You could remind them that Roman children had no limitations on screen time but conversely could be sold not slavery by their parents. Is that what they want?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Let&amp;#39;s see. A quick google says His height is 236,000 parasangs, each being 3 miles. Roughly, that&amp;#39;s 600k miles to a 6&amp;#39; foot tall man, or a ratio of 100k X 5.286k or (again roughly) a scale of 500 million to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson A book cover is a roughly 2 decimeters, 200m nanometers. Which means one book cover&amp;#39;s worth of God&amp;#39;s Supernal Body is about half a nanometer of a human.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Which seems to be about five hydrogen atoms lined up, so presumably a moderately complex protein or two. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lwhJ5WEt7u&quot;&gt;https://t.co/lwhJ5WEt7u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Hmmm....&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah To be fair to YU, I felt the same as a straight student back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah One of the most important lessons I learned at Yeshiva College is that Institutions act neither for the good of the ostensible human constituents, or toward their stated values, but for their self preservation and aggrandizement. An important but painful lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bernstein_judah Yes.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@WinterlightHome There are probably a couple small schools in those towns with similar educational neglect, but nothing massive on the scale of the Satmar system in NY — and bringing in that kind of state aid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@WinterlightHome Chabadniks will send their kids to a community day school, but if there is a critical mass will start their own cheder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;“It is entirely possible for yeshivas to offer enriching English, math, and science education at the same time as a strong grounding in religious texts and Jewish tradition – indeed, many do.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XlTxV90ySS&quot;&gt;https://t.co/XlTxV90ySS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“I know it personally, because many of my friends and colleagues are smart, well-educated yeshiva graduates.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nice to see the seamless spectrum of Orthodoxy being used against the right, for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the organizational level, Agudah has Satmar’s back. The OU seems to have been conspicuously silent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that Lander is a city-wide elected official, so his constituents include Orthodox Jews who resent the implicit (and sometimes explicit) chassidic claim that they’re G-d-forsaking goyim for educating their children in English and math.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<source:markdown>“It is entirely possible for yeshivas to offer enriching English, math, and science education at the same time as a strong grounding in religious texts and Jewish tradition – indeed, many do.” https://t.co/XlTxV90ySS&#10;&#10;&#10;“I know it personally, because many of my friends and colleagues are smart, well-educated yeshiva graduates.”&#10;&#10;Nice to see the seamless spectrum of Orthodoxy being used against the right, for a change.&#10;&#10;On the organizational level, Agudah has Satmar’s back. The OU seems to have been conspicuously silent.&#10;&#10;Note that Lander is a city-wide elected official, so his constituents include Orthodox Jews who resent the implicit (and sometimes explicit) chassidic claim that they’re G-d-forsaking goyim for educating their children in English and math.&#10;&#10;</source:markdown>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper If America’s Mayor has been paying attention, a kosher meal order wouldn’t necessary disqualify a lawyer from being an observant Muslim. Considering kosher meat to be halal is a mainstream shariah position.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper He’d be taking a gamble that no wine or alcohol was used in the cooking, but probably not an unreasonable gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper Pretty sure that Mukasey is an observant Jew.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper The “anti-Shariah Law” movement radicalized knowledgable Orthodox Jews against islamophobia, because Shariah plays an identical role in American jurisprudence as does Jewish Halacha. As it pretty much does in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
