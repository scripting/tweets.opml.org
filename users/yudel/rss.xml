			<description>&lt;p&gt;@ChadAChavez @Litejedi @joshtpm @ijkijKevin Think stupider. I think he just doesn’t like being told what to do, so who took papers that crossed his desk and didn’t give them back when asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@gerrycanavan @trekonomics I think he just has problems with authority. It’s all just a dominance game for him. Yes, he’s venal, but he’s also deeply stupid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@gerrycanavan @trekonomics Being stupid means you don’t understand basic things about your line of work. What happened to Patreus and Sandy Berger never registers — or you see that they didn’t get the high end of the possible sentence, and figure you can wiggle out too.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@gerrycanavan @trekonomics I assume that bureaucrats who are read into classified info learn to take it seriously — akin to how my dad taught me to handle a gun, a lesson he learned in the army back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@gerrycanavan @trekonomics But there’s a level of stupidity where you tune out the explicit lessons and don’t pick up on any of the quiet cultural signals surrounding the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@gerrycanavan @trekonomics That’s why Ari Fleischer is so flustered. The guy committed a federal crime, turned down multiple chances to come clean and be forgiven, and gained absolutely nothing by it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@gerrycanavan @trekonomics It’s exactly like Hillary’s email server only ten times stupider and ten times more criminal.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Good case to be made that the right to own information necessary to construct nuclear weapons falls within the penumbra of the Second Amendment. Considering pitching this idea to The Federalist or the WSJ Op Ed page.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Actually, this opens an avenue for a Second Amendment defense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics How can one criminalize information useful in properly arming one’s militia?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics My current theory is that after losing the election, he petulantly refused to put anything in the “to archive” box and just took it up his quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Simply a spoiled kid without a law-abiding bone in his body.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics And then when he was caught he kept playing the same game.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Not that dissimilar to forcing subcontractors to sue for payment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Given that he doesn’t read the documents, he might have had no idea what was in them. And no curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Add an abiding resentment that Hillary “got away with” acid washing emails, why should he listen to some silly lawyer telling him what to do?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Credit for this idea goes to @joshtpm’s “Trump’s Razor” and asking, “what’s the stupidest possibility for what’s going on?”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics We’ll try to stay serene and calm / when Mar-a-Lago gets the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics I still believe this was general lawlessness and criminality not an effort to sell secrets. Foreign governments are traditionally willing to accept nuclear secrets in photographic reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering how Maga land is responding to Garland: The Post Millenial sent our four tweets, highlighting Garland’s not taking questions, none mentioning the request to unseal the warrant.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AkivaMCohen Also, the warrant and receipt is damning.
