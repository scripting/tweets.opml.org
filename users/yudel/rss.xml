			<description>@KWiersoAgain @mjs_DC @Slate This is how secession begins. Texas demands that its hitherto unconstitutional laws be enforced in California. California refuses. The Feds take Texas’ side. Corporations decide the prefer Blue America with its respect for the rule of law, and there you are.&#10;&#10;@KWiersoAgain @mjs_DC @Slate Which would explain the brand new National Review / Tikvah Fund / et al open letter defending “The rule of law” without naming who it was subtweeting.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>I wonder who was the person at AIPAC who decided that “Zionism is anti-progressivism” was a great message to propagate. I’m old enough to remember when such talk was considered antisemitic. Seems suboptimal, as they say. https://t.co/WgWD3S34Du&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is the grim future Jared Kushner and the Republicans wanted — and the Democrats are too lilly-livered to fight against. https://t.co/DuCpHNc4Kw&#10;&#10;Funny how the “Problem solver caucus” couldn’t push for more covid relief.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JewishWonk This may actually be a criminal offense of “harassment” under NJ law. Might be one in NY too if that’s where you are these days. Might be fun to find a local prosecutor with free time and political ambitions willing to prosecute.&#10;&#10;@JewishWonk Here’s my thread with the NJ law, which I stumbled across while working on a story about @ORAAgunot. Picketing a get refuser politely does *not* constitute harassment according to the court ruling I reviewed, but the purpose was not to “annoy” the refuser.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@joshtpm @wealth I find it hard to believe that Twitter’s obvious failures as an advertising platform is the blame of its ad director rather than something more substantial in its corporate makeup.&#10;&#10;@joshtpm @wealth However, exiting him now with an NDA might delay the new owner’s ability to fire the culprit until their options vest.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@mjs_DC @Slate I just stumbled across NJ’s harassment law, which would appear to (lightly) criminalize social media harassment such as posting antisemitic memes of ovens and the like that are designed to annoy Jews. Might that offer a safe haven for social media companies to enforce their TOS?&#10;&#10;@mjs_DC @Slate Link to the criminal code. https://t.co/lz0tPRFHVd&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What’s fascinating is that this “philanthropist” is spending $50 million over a decade to do what the ADL does, but somehow differently, without being able to articulate how. https://t.co/sz4HShq2J5&#10;&#10;Maybe I’m cynical about the pliability of Jewish organizations, but I bet if I offered them that sum of money to try a new approach — say, pursuing social media harassers under state law — they wouldn’t turn down the money.&#10;&#10;Conversely, if I wanted them to adopt a policy inconsistent with their approach — say, seeking a constitutional amendment to repeal the First Amendment — then I would be willing to proclaim my disagreement.&#10;&#10;Which is to say, while this is certainly good for Mr Kraft’s ego, it’s hard to believe this is the optimal use of this money to fight antisemitism, let alone to help the Jewish people.&#10;&#10;Note that this sum of money would suffice to bring back @heyBimBam’s project of Jewish educational YouTube videos and fund it for a generation.&#10;&#10;Note that half of what YouTube returns right now for a search on “Passover״ are produced by Christian ministries. https://t.co/R2TJ3qo3MG&#10;&#10;Finally, while @heyBimBam was a $600k/year operation that probably needed a bit more to be sustainable, I have some exciting print-based ideas for Jewish publishing that could launch with $10k. My dms are open.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Some further thoughts on this (with the reminder that I am not, it should be obvious, a lawyer, though I did cosplay one for years as a yeshiva student). https://t.co/ImSRmh8lSd&#10;&#10;Under New Jersey law, it seems that what #onhere think of as antisemitic harassment is in fact a criminal offence. At least according to my amateur reading of NJ Code of Criminal Justice 2C:33-4. https://t.co/XS68wZPMqb&#10;&#10;2C:33-4.  Harassment.&#10;&#10;...a person commits a petty disorderly persons offense if, with purpose to harass another, he:&#10;&#10;a. Makes, or causes to be made, a communication or communications anonymously or at extremely inconvenient hours, or in offensively coarse language, or any other manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm;&#10;&#10;Fair to say that most of what talk about as harassment is indeed designed to cause annoyance and alarm.&#10;&#10;So there is actually a reasonable overlap between Twitter's TOC and this criminal offense.&#10;&#10;So Twitter can legally continue to police hate speech (which uses words chosen to cause annoyance) and harassment. At least as far as New Jersey user is involved.&#10;&#10;Also worth noting that the court ruling I am currently reading for other purposes dismisses a claim under this statute for a peaceful protest outside the plaintiff's parents' residence. So annoyance here does not mean simply, &quot;I don't want this speaker in my general vicinity.&quot;&#10;&#10;</description>
