			<description>@Shmarya I‚Äôd say that the awkwardly named ideology called ‚Äúpro-Israelism‚Äù is the problem, and the heresy.&#10;&#10;@Shmarya States are problematic and in need of constant critique, as exemplified by the Biblical prophets. Zionism was about building power. Pro-Israelism is about defending and expanding power to the exclusion of other values.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@datadivajf Given that it's a neo-pre-seat-belt society, the shocker is that there aren't ash trays at all the consoles.&#10;&#10;@datadivajf Was seatbelt technology lost in WWIII? Or was it never invented, perhaps as a result of McCoy's travel back to early 20th century NYC?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@HannahLebovits @cwjisrael A real cynic would look at the role agunot have in performing sacrifice in a community that by and large no longer has to sacrifice material well being (with the possible exception of yeshiva tuition) to maintain their religious observance.&#10;&#10;@HannahLebovits @cwjisrael And whether the price of losing that performance motivates Orthodox rabbinic leaders who loudly champion social media campaigns while quietly and effectively sabotaging innovative halachic solutions.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@roeiwrites Some related points: 1) There are no consequences for a certain type of pundit in being consistently wrong. Wertheimer is in good company with Gulf War promoters, Brett Stevens, and Bibi Netanyahu.&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites 2) Wertheimer was a top JTS official when it collapsed, along with Consetvative synagogue affiliation. This was in part because American Jews had dropped old models of Judaism (of which intermarriage is one symptom) but also because of structural and institutional failures.&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites To my knowledge, the only response Wertheimer offered was to lament that Jews no longer felt a sense of ‚Äúobligation.‚Äù&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites At no time did he utilize scholarly models of religion or theology or sociology to figure out what was going on. He stuck with the pre-modern notion that if we just preach harder, people will change their ways.&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites (The fact that that model didn‚Äôt work for Isaiah or Jeremiah or the Hatam Sofer seems to have escaped him.)&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites His insistence on seeing American Judaism through traditional categories was a profound epistemological mistake with real communal and institutional consequences.&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites 3) One ‚Äúexit interview‚Äù question I would like to ask the non and no-longer affiliated is whether the rise of religious extremism in Christian America, Jewish Israel, and the Muslim world had any impact on their view of religious worship.&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites One result of the neoconservative movement‚Äôs successful effort to normalize Jews affiliating as Republican, even as the party more and more embraced an extremist religious agenda. I wonder about that effort‚Äôs impact on affiliation with Conservative Judaism, which unlike Reform&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites has not placed fighting white Christian extremism in all its aspects as a central or even nominal mandate.&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites 4) I doubt Wertheimer will be pleased by the announcement just now that JTS has named Rabbi Ayelet Cohen as its new rabbinical school dean, given her track record as a leader of the New Israel Fund and Congregation Bet Simchat Torah, NY‚Äôs pioneer gay shul.&#10;&#10;@roeiwrites 5) Maintaining ‚ÄúJewish identity‚Äù in a voluntary society is a hard problem. Explaining why that might be a valuable goal is also a hard problem, but not one I believe Wertheimer ever undertook.&#10;&#10;</description>
