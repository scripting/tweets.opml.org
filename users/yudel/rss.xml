			<description>@onthemainline @moshe_kolat We are considering publishing a volume of Jewish takes on childrens stories. This could be a great premise for such a take.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DrMarinaArcher @waltshaub Seems like there ought to be provisions for, “if you feel you must break the law and destroy records, please don’t hurt the plumbing by flushing them and please have a fire extinguisher if you’re going to burn them.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Hard to believe we’ve been on Twitter for years without spotting a Yehezkel Kaufman reference but glad to say that drought is over. https://t.co/HebvHK09jN&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This may well be deeply concerning. But…. https://t.co/YjDYJyogqX&#10;&#10;One distressing fact in the present moment is that American governance is deeply broken by the Republican prioritization of waging war against the Democrats above everything else.&#10;&#10;The Atlantic recently reported that when Syria crossed Obama’s red line and used poison gas, Obama decided that waging was was a job for Congress and he approached McConnell — who declined to act.&#10;&#10;After all, why hand Obama a foreign policy win?&#10;&#10;As we’ve seen with the slow walking of approving key foreign policy posts, the Republicans are doing the minimum to support US foreign policy.&#10;&#10;(Note that they allowed a Republican to hold up Iron Dome aid, figuring that Israel supporters wouldn’t hold the party accountable, and they were right. As @rmneiss has documented, AIPAC spent ten times more attacking the Democrats who initially opposed the aid than&#10;&#10;the Republican who continued to object for several more months.)&#10;&#10;From the perspective of Joe Biden, foreign policy as usual saves him from Republican criticism. And they, for better or worse, seems to be a major goal of his.&#10;&#10;If the Iran deal falls apart, that will be why. Unlike Obama, who was an idealist, Biden will be making a political decision. I think Obama was legit scared by Bibi into seeking the deal — much to Bibi’s chagrin, of course.&#10;&#10;Faced with the mental image of nuked Israelis, Obama was willing to spend political capital to slow Iran’s drive to the bomb. Biden is not.&#10;&#10;Frankly, I can’t say I blame him.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@allshiny Hmmm. A possible recommendation for us guilty carnivores. (Or non-practicing vegetarians, as we prefer to call ourselves.) if I may ask: How old were you when you stopped eating meat?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ShulimLeifer Whereas his school would no doubt suggest Tehillim. Which I believe were tried during last century’s great German unpleasantness. How did that work out again?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AD_Lobel I would not travel with that man, who clearly does not know how to hire qualified people. Though really, preferring to communicate by snailmail is a red flag, as I tell people who don’t want to submit doc or pdf files.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@evawyner @kampeas Lot of people loved President Obama, but so few renamed their school after him…. :-)&#10;&#10;@evawyner @kampeas I went to Cleveland’s Agnon School, which was also renamed, so I share in the alumni outrage over the renaming.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@hondanhon Any failure to hire a bunch of Cubans to kidnap six Republican senators and threaten to shoot them one by one until the Court is expanded and the filibuster is repealed is a Democratic failure.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It’s possible that @MarginaliaROB is only the second publication to write about this theological work. If you’re not following them, you should. https://t.co/zIQlzVzo9i&#10;&#10;The first might have been the @JewishStandard. But since not all Jewish thought is written by North Jersey authors, Marginalia is a more comprehensive resource.&#10;&#10;Here’s my piece: https://t.co/hb38Jg5Rii&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Octalthorpe @datadivajf Seems likely that they’re setting up for the prediction to fail. One of the kids he sees himself saving — whose records he called up in Ep 3 — is going to die. I wonder if the writers will give them a red shirt.&#10;&#10;@Octalthorpe @datadivajf I wonder if that will be part of a season cliffhanger.&#10;&#10;</description>
