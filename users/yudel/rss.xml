			<description>@johnpavlovitz We have a “Republicans believe guns are the solution” problem. The question is what is the problem they hope to solve by arming our civilian teens with military weapons.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>America has no gun problem. America has guns because the dominant Republican Party sees an America flooded with AR-15s as a solution. The only question is what problems is the Republican Party trying to solve by giving AR-15s to civilian teens. https://t.co/IKAcKb2eIn&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dzkalman There is no gun problem. Guns are the chosen solution of the dominant Republican Party. The question is what is the problem to which Republican-approved AR-15s are the solution.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@schraubd @ZacharyBraiterm So they agree with AIPAC that the question of the 10 million or so people living in Mandatory Palestine is more important than are the well-being of hundreds of millions of Americans.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics Kinda natural to hate your job and its subject matter after a few decades.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics Anyway, did you know that if the moon was made of green cheese lunar mining could displace the methane emissions of dairy cows equivalent to two million cars driving two million miles for two million years?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EmExAstris It would be really trivial for IG to show me the problematic post and what policy it violated. The fact they don’t can only spark speculation.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EmExAstris The lack of transparency in these decisions fuels conspiracy theories. Maybe that’s the point. https://t.co/eoR5Ib0HFh&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@maimonides_nutz I don’t see why not. There are ways to mitigate your exposure. Perhaps Google for suggestions shy of her going cold turkey, but there are ample ways to reduce the smoke levels.&#10;&#10;@maimonides_nutz https://t.co/1t3rtD3x6Z&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Yes, Satmar prioritizes the abuser over the abused. Hard to imagine why a group that believes in an unaccountable, all-powerful deity mediated by unaccountable clergy would favor an abuse over his young female victims. https://t.co/wvoPy0ETHq&#10;&#10;Tell me again how monotheism makes people better, and is a “Jewish contribution to civilization?”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Not unrelated to the question of regulating of social media giants, I just had a very unpleasant experience with @instagram. https://t.co/HhCsYaXWXb&#10;&#10;@instagram I've made perhaps half a dozen posts on IG; I guess none in the past 30 days, if Meta, a company that has lied to Congress and the courts, is telling the truth.&#10;&#10;I've received no notices from IG on what pieces of their Terms of Service I am accused of violating, which is why I did not appeal in the putative 30 days.&#10;&#10;However: If I were to tell an unhappy client or vendor that I was no longer dealing with them, because they had violated the contract, but I refused to say how -- well, that would be problematic.&#10;&#10;If I stopped hosting a client's web site because they had 'violated the contract' and then refused to tell them what piece of the contract they had violated -- well, I would imagine there would be consequences.&#10;&#10;And if I told a judge that they violated terms with their content, which I had since deleted and had no record of -- well, that judge wouldn't have to deliberate very hard.&#10;&#10;And if I told the judge that I had relied on an automated pornography monitoring program in decreeing the contract terminated and applied no personal judgement -- well, that might be seen as being irresponsible.&#10;&#10;So: The question is whether I have a cause of action.&#10;&#10;Thanks to Texas Republican granny-killer Governor Greg Abbott, I actually do.&#10;&#10;Given that *everything* I posted was designed to express a Jewish viewpoint, if there was any actual content moderation decision made in my cancellation, then it was viewpoint discrimination.&#10;&#10;So: Is there anybody in Texas who might have an interest in the @BenYehudaPress IG content, please contact me.&#10;&#10;@BenYehudaPress Meta's failure to provide a transparent process of account cancelation is ultimately a scandal of unaccountable monopolies.&#10;&#10;Having an account with Facebook, or Twitter, or Instagram, or Amazon, actually is a valuable thing. Corporation shouldn't be able to deprive people of valuable things without due process.&#10;&#10;Anyway, my DMs are open if anyone wants to have fun in a Texas court.&#10;&#10;Shoutout to @AkivaMCohen and @mjs_DC who have been a very useful legal education the past year or so, and are *by no means* responsible for the content of this thread.&#10;&#10;</description>
