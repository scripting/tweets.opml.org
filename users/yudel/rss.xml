			<description>@erinbiba As someone who spends most of my time in front of a computer screen, I got a prescription for reading at that distance. (Further than I hold a book, much further than I hold the phone.) It’s been great.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>It’s easy to dismiss Elliott Abrams as the man who lied to Congress to cover up the massacre of peasants by the death squads he supported. But according to this thread, he’s actually worse. https://t.co/MS9ruufnAH&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@notrivia @DrZackaryBerger Maybe look into who Gottheimer’s fundrrd are, and who else they find.&#10;&#10;@notrivia @DrZackaryBerger I had the occasion to look into the campaign contributions of a billionaire being picketed by @truahrabbis for opposing a labor agreement approved by all the other companies in his industry. https://t.co/J2d7ZvDToy&#10;&#10;@notrivia @DrZackaryBerger @truahrabbis Lo and behold, he funds  the Republican Party — and Senator Sinema and Congressman Gottheimer.&#10;&#10;@notrivia @DrZackaryBerger @truahrabbis Given the congressman’s willingness to tell lies about progressives — and to shout “antisemitism!” when called on it — not sure there’s any reason to take his claims in good faith.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>This is related to the fact that Israeli ultra orthodox leaders are fighting phones not under their control as a threat to their community’s staying faithful. https://t.co/S2I5KbxKPz&#10;&#10;Or the statement by my Talmud teacher at Yeshiva University that an honest, objective study of Judaism at the university’s graduate school — undertaken with academic methods but by Orthodox professors — would lead to apostasy.&#10;&#10;Because religious fundamentalism can’t survive an honest inquiry. And at the same time, the kind of “scholarship” promoted in yeshivas works very well to close off independent thought.&#10;&#10;As it is written: “Girls go to college to get more knowledge. Boys go to kollel on Jupiter to get more stupider.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EbWatchesTrek Given that this episode added more characters whose stories will resonate with Spock’s loss — as well as strong reminders that Michael’s story is deeply classified — I suspect the writers are going there.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Tl;dr&amp;gt; My book debunking a Christian extremist reading of the Torah is free on the Kindle store for the next couple of days. Read on for the back story, and maybe a few tidbits. https://t.co/EjHpOCIoPz&#10;&#10;Back in the days of George W. Bush, the Forward featured David Klinghoffer as a regular conservative columnist. (The Forward was liberal at the time.) As is the ways of newspapers, he was never fact checked.&#10;&#10;And is the ways of conservatives — he was an editor at the National Review — he was a political operative, not a theologian. Though he had written a book about his &quot;Journey to Jewish Orthodoxy.&quot; https://t.co/qypJTQRv10&#10;&#10;Every installment I was tempted to write a rebuttal to the editor — but never did.&#10;&#10;So when I learned that he was putting out a book in advance of the 2008 election entitled “How Would God Vote: Why the Bible Commands You to Be a Conservative,&quot; I knew it demanded rebutting. https://t.co/uVhzDvw0El&#10;&#10;So I put out a call for collaborators to rebut the book --- ideally, within 30 days after its release, since an election was coming up.&#10;https://t.co/83j34Z5LVz&#10;&#10;As it happened, only one person answered my call: Yori Yanover, my boss at the Jewish Communications Network (AKA https://t.co/thUparRLOP) at the dawn of the Web  and author of &quot;The Cabalist's Daughter: A Novel of Practical Messianic Redemption Paperback.&quot; https://t.co/t6ot6Q9xdl&#10;&#10;So we divided Klinghoffer's chapters and wrote our rebuttals as fast as we could. We didn't attack all of his arguments -- he supported reparations for African Americans, and gun control in a nod to contrarianism -- and time of course was a limiting factor. https://t.co/OcMuCTnAAy&#10;&#10;But we did go after his attacks on gay marriage, feminism, divorce, evolution, progressive taxation, and health care (not just government funded health care -- he suggested that all medical care is bad because it will decrease people's tendency to pray. Really!) https://t.co/U3Tz1dREc3&#10;&#10;And we went after his calls for capital punishment, the drug war, and the Iraq War. As we bloggers used to say back in those days, we gave him a good fisking -- and offered readers some laughs along the way. https://t.co/jPMIJqitUK&#10;&#10;Did the book have an impact? Well, it came out before the election, and Obama won the election. On the other hand, the book sold dozens rather than hundreds of copies. On the third hand, David Klinghoffer never opined on Jewish affairs again. So a win? https://t.co/4Lo7gnrRjk&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, if you want to read some pilpul justifying the progressive opinions on these issues, and pick up some deep background on the nature of the religious right that has installed the current #RogueSCOTUS -- well, it's free! What do you have to lose? https://t.co/EjHpOCIoPz&#10;&#10;</description>
