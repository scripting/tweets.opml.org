			<description>@abesilbe @rabbimargulies @MisfitTorah Yes. Kahane was theologically wrong. (His sociological insights are more mixed.) What Kahane gave me at that point of time was an English-language theology that explained the actions of Gush Emunim.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@MisfitTorah Kahane has explained that such use of power is actually a kiddush Hashem. I think it‚Äôs in one of his 80s books. Worth reading to understand that this is a theological disagreement you‚Äôre having.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Everybody knows about Yeshiva Rabbeinu Yitzchak Elchanan (aka YU's RIETS seminary) but who remembers the Elhanan Spektor Lodge of B'nai B'rith? https://t.co/RJI1kWu9Zd&#10;&#10;The October 29, 1897 issue of the the San Francisco Jewish publication currently known as J: The Jewish News of Northern California reports as follows: https://t.co/0xeYN1MTui&#10;&#10;A new B'nai B'rith Lodge, composed of Russian-born young men, is to be soon organized under the name of Elhanan Spektor Lodge. The name is well chosen. Elhanan Spektor, now gone to his reward, was in all respects the finest type of the scholar and Zaddig these years have produced https://t.co/bbtLVy7jgC&#10;&#10;Tolerant, just, pious and gentle, his virtues d√©serve commemoration amongst those of his countrymen who desire his name to be perpetuated on this side of the globe.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@gabrielwinant It‚Äôs an embodiment of a fascist Christian theology, that *assumes* an all-powerful being would harbor infinite resentment.&#10;&#10;@gabrielwinant Which turns greed (wanting to have been created sooner) and resentment (punishing those who had not helped him) into divine values.&#10;&#10;@gabrielwinant It‚Äôs Ayn Rand meets Fire and Brinstone. So prototypically American.&#10;&#10;@gabrielwinant The fact people take it seriously implies a profound lack of philosophical training among seemingly smart people.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EladNehorai If it‚Äôs any comfort, @instagram cancelled my seldom used, very lame @BenYehudaPress account for reasons they won‚Äôt deign to tell me because 30 days have expired and we all know how hard document retention is.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Stupid, unappealable cancellation is really not viable. Speaking as such a victim.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Charge $25 for a review by a real person. That would pay for 15 minutes of a real person‚Äôs time to review the offending post in context.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Or charge $50 and refund half if the appeal is granted.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety But meanwhile he should file a complaint in Texas court.&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety I‚Äôm actually considering notifying IG‚Äôs legal department of my intent to file. What *is* the Texas filing fee?&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety How much would a Waco attorney charge to file if I were to draft the papers?&#10;&#10;@AkivaMCohen @TwitterSafety Happy to sign an affidavit that to the best of my recollection all my posts expressed the viewpoint that everyone should buy my Jewish books.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@alanabbey Looks familiar. Lax? EWR? Do all airports *except* BG look the same?&#10;&#10;@alanabbey Given that they‚Äôre collecting via PayPal, and PayPal notoriously is difficult for Palestinians to access, one has to question their authenticity.&#10;&#10;@alanabbey However, scamming Red Army supporters doesn‚Äôt bother me much so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas This was indeed a fun one.&#10;&#10;@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas What would be involved in creating supplemental volumes? Essential Papers on the Talmud from the Clinton Administration and After? (That volume is copyright ‚Äò94.)&#10;&#10;@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas Anyone who knows one of the fields covered by that NYU series and would like to curate a volume, my dms are open!&#10;&#10;@tamar_marvin @DBashIdeas Though I should probably start by asking Rabbi Chernick, whose Sunday morning Talmud shiur I was privileged to attend for several years.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@dick_nixon Sir, I am sorry to say you were not loved by the eight year olds in my suburban private liberal Jewish school in advance of your re-election.&#10;&#10;@dick_nixon And that was without any of us knowing the, shall we say, unseemly conversation you had on my eighth birthday which was 6/23/72. Kind of scars a ten-year-old‚Äôs faith in authority to learn how a president, even one he despised, obstructed justice on his eighth birthday.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Area rabbi defends AIPAC funding insurrectionists. Let me know if you find it convincing. https://t.co/kZbaZ3vhl0&#10;&#10;Worth noting that for all his talk of supporting liberal causes, he does not seem to have submitted any op-eds to his local Jewish paper making the argument for BLM and the like.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@DBashIdeas You'd have to look at the way &quot;The Zohar&quot; is in part the creation of the printer who first collected the Aramaic manuscripts, some of which had circulated separately.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas And the way that printing enabled a book that proclaimed to be holy but was not already considered authoritative to circulate widely -- and thereby be accepted and become canon.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas How much did the steadily declining price of print enable the spread of Chassidus in the 18th century?&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas Would the Baal Hatanya had written his own Shulchan Aruch, which spoke on behalf of a small portion of the Ashkenazic community, if printing costs were what they had been in the time of the Shulchan Aruch and the Rama, who between two of the wrote down the halacha for all Jewry?&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas Obviously, the Haskala was a product of print, like the Renaissance which inspired it.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas In the 20th century, someone reinvested money made selling lead dreidels on the Lower East Side to buy a printing press and founded Ktav.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas The development of computer-based phototypesetting meant that ArtScroll could start doing pre-Mac proto-desktop publishing for a relative pittance -- and once they bought that for invitations, why not write a commentary on Megilat Esther?&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas It shouldn't be too hard to find the costs of typesetting a volume of the Soncino Tanakh in the 40s versus an Artscroll volume in the 80s.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas My @BenYehudaPress only exists because of cheaper printing technology. The spark was my discovery of the availability of Print on Demand technology coupled with widespread distribution.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress I don't need to sell 5,000 copies to justify printing costs, and I don't have to warehouse 5,000 copies until they all sell.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress Going back a generation, it's hard to believe that the ability of everyone in the YU beis medresh to have a $20 photo offset set of Shas didn't have any affect on what was learned and taught.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress Were there shiurim that dealt with a list of sources that would be unfeasible to demand of students in Volozhin? Certainly a topic for investigation.&#10;&#10;@DBashIdeas @BenYehudaPress The final chapter of the book describes Sefaria, its founding, its funding, and its acquisition of the Steinsaltz translation of Shas. I'm very much looking forward to the repercussions of that act in the decades ahead.&#10;&#10;</description>
