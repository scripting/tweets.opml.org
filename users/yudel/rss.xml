			<description>This, very much this. I just want to add that the below cited David Brooks was awarded a journalism prize by the NY Jewish Week a few years back. It would be nice to see some soul searching from those responsible. https://t.co/0cPWkwCDfq&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Signatures just arrived for a second book of translated Yiddish poetry. https://t.co/ZMZGeQPYoa&#10;&#10;This will be a deluxe presentation of a work by an already well-known Yiddish poetry. The other title is a true rediscovery.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EladNehorai It feels gone because our political leaders — Joe and Nancy — keep telling us not to politicize it.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai Every Republican should be called to account for enabling these massacres.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai Every granddaughter of a Fox News guzzling “Reagan Democrat” should be given a script to challenge her grandfather for enabling the stripping of her rights — and pushing his support for overturning Dobbs.&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai Not only is the Jewish community not questioning what it means to have former Republican apparatchiks in high places, but we have no formal pushback against well funded efforts to bring more in in the baje of “ideological diversity.”&#10;&#10;@EladNehorai We have Republicans blocking domestic terror legislation and no one calling them out.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Note the dishonesty of these  religiously-raised “Newsweek” opiners. The left has a solution popular with most of the country: ban AR-15s. The right minority keeps blocking it. And the role of the Carson fan girl is to obscure the fact through both-siding it.&#10;&#10;But one thing you learn well in a yeshiva or Liberty University is how to obscure facts.&#10;&#10;Oops. Forgot to attach the screenshot. https://t.co/Yo8AbaS4DD&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@KurtBusiek @lithub So I tried to get an AI (https://t.co/RHa9NvOigR) to write a script. This is the best it came up with:&#10;&#10;@KurtBusiek @lithub In 1955, Faulkner attended a literary conference in the University of Virginia. He was bored by the speeches, so he decided to amuse himself by writing an episode of &quot;Car 54&quot;.&#10;He rewrote it several times, and the final version was printed in Esquire magazine.&#10;&#10;@KurtBusiek @lithub The story takes place when a pregnant nun (played by actress Barbara Werle) is kidnapped by a gang of thieves.&#10;This episode was never produced, but Faulkner was delighted with it. He sent it to his agent, who showed it to clients.&#10;&#10;@KurtBusiek @lithub Apparently, it was too expensive to shoot, so never appeared on the air. Faulkner was disappointed.&#10;After his death, the story was forgotten.&#10;&#10;@KurtBusiek @lithub In 2000, it was discovered by the collector Scott Meredith.&#10;In 2003, it was published for the first time, in the book &quot;The Other Side of Car 54, Where Are You?&quot;&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Really amazing that the Jewish community is supporting two laws related to hate crime reporting and weeding out neo-Nazis from law enforcement and the Republicans are almost universally opposed and the conversation keeps going back to &quot;left-wing antisemitism.&quot;&#10;&#10;This bill passed the House on almost straight party lines and died in the face of the Senate's unconstitutional supermajority requirement on straight party lines. https://t.co/LBSQtybPk1&#10;&#10;The even less ambitious Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault, and Threats to Equality Act, which would incentivize local police departments to report hate crimes, is similarly DOA due to Republican opposition.&#10;&#10;It has 90 Democratic an 15 Republican cosponsors in the House; in the Senate, only two of its 24 cosponsors are Republican. https://t.co/nJPabw5Maf&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, JFNA says its recent top lobbying priorities were antisemitism and hate crime laws, including these, but their whole press release is a paen to foreign issues and domestic bipartisanship. https://t.co/GZ2bGfy0fl&#10;&#10;</description>
