			<description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, Isaac Asimov made science fiction publishing seem like the most exciting industry in the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m incredibly delighted to be able to pre-announce another volume of original Jewish science fiction, from the same editorial team that produced Other Covenants. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/Oq1fMlaPsn&quot;&gt;https://t.co/Oq1fMlaPsn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;A formal announcement and call for submissions will wait until 2023, but you can find the tentative title and subtitle on the Other Covenants Kickstarter page. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VNbsvhGJMr&quot;&gt;https://t.co/VNbsvhGJMr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And despite the trials and tribulations that made their  crazy dream of &amp;quot;an alternate Jewish history anthology&amp;quot; take far longer than expected, @AD_Lobel  and @MarkShainblum are eager to create Jewish publishing history yet again. I couldn&amp;#39;t be more excited to help them.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@rmneiss Shurat Hadin seems to be taking credit for it, so not really anonymous. And since these are said to be Israeli students, I can guess whose money is behind it and they might even admit it if I called their fancy pr firm to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@EladNehorai Also, the precise opposite of the truth of the past century of American Jewish history. “Jewish pride” manifested in the 70s after the decline and canceling of antisemitism in the previous two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson As I see it, the “best” case for him is that he just petulantly packed up rather than file everything that crossed his desk after he lost the election. So these could be boxes of McDonald’s receipts. And the occasional notes on a PDB.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson Just his habitual law breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson Still a phenomenal hill for a party to die on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson Worst case is actual sellable security secrets he had no need to access and evidence of crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson I certainly would want to see the FBI receipt before jumping to his defense…&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm This behavior points to big-time criming. But Trump’s Razor suggests that it’s all receipts for McDonalds takeout and similarly trivial records that he petulantly refused to file according to protocol (and law) after the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Probably some colorful PDBs for Dummies and the like, but mostly just trivia, held on to for the sake of gratuitous rule-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm So no smoking gun memos which could possibly be forged and planted; just ten boxes of junk, with the equivalent of pizza recipes and gefilte fish tariff negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
