			<description>&lt;p&gt;@protecttruth_ @joshtpm @AJentleson But if the Democrats vote to let it go through, it would require Republicans to filibuster an abortion bill — which would come back to haunt them in primaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@thelibbiegrant @DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper Yes. There are certain aspects of Muslim observance that my former mayor would do well to take on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@thelibbiegrant @DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper Though it’s amazing how much alcohol abuse one can get away with if one is fundamentally decent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@WinterlightHome There are probably a couple small schools in those towns with similar educational neglect, but nothing massive on the scale of the Satmar system in NY — and bringing in that kind of state aid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@WinterlightHome Chabadniks will send their kids to a community day school, but if there is a critical mass will start their own cheder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@DemocraticLuntz So you&amp;#39;re saying he hates when that happens?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DemocraticLuntz I just casually assumed that his hell is being sentenced to be the videographer in someone else&amp;#39;s sex-crazed heaven.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;“It is entirely possible for yeshivas to offer enriching English, math, and science education at the same time as a strong grounding in religious texts and Jewish tradition – indeed, many do.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XlTxV90ySS&quot;&gt;https://t.co/XlTxV90ySS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“I know it personally, because many of my friends and colleagues are smart, well-educated yeshiva graduates.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nice to see the seamless spectrum of Orthodoxy being used against the right, for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the organizational level, Agudah has Satmar’s back. The OU seems to have been conspicuously silent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that Lander is a city-wide elected official, so his constituents include Orthodox Jews who resent the implicit (and sometimes explicit) chassidic claim that they’re G-d-forsaking goyim for educating their children in English and math.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper If America’s Mayor has been paying attention, a kosher meal order wouldn’t necessary disqualify a lawyer from being an observant Muslim. Considering kosher meat to be halal is a mainstream shariah position.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper He’d be taking a gamble that no wine or alcohol was used in the cooking, but probably not an unreasonable gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper Pretty sure that Mukasey is an observant Jew.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper The “anti-Shariah Law” movement radicalized knowledgable Orthodox Jews against islamophobia, because Shariah plays an identical role in American jurisprudence as does Jewish Halacha. As it pretty much does in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
