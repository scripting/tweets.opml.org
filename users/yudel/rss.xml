			<description>@HareianiBlog @rabbijilljacobs @eJPhil Is there anything less elite than perjuring oneself before Congress to cover up the massacre of peasants, and then getting a cushy non-profit post opining in ethics?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EbWatchesTrek Given that this episode added more characters whose stories will resonate with Spock’s loss — as well as strong reminders that Michael’s story is deeply classified — I suspect the writers are going there.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Tl;dr&amp;gt; My book debunking a Christian extremist reading of the Torah is free on the Kindle store for the next couple of days. Read on for the back story, and maybe a few tidbits. https://t.co/EjHpOCIoPz&#10;&#10;Back in the days of George W. Bush, the Forward featured David Klinghoffer as a regular conservative columnist. (The Forward was liberal at the time.) As is the ways of newspapers, he was never fact checked.&#10;&#10;And is the ways of conservatives — he was an editor at the National Review — he was a political operative, not a theologian. Though he had written a book about his &quot;Journey to Jewish Orthodoxy.&quot; https://t.co/qypJTQRv10&#10;&#10;Every installment I was tempted to write a rebuttal to the editor — but never did.&#10;&#10;So when I learned that he was putting out a book in advance of the 2008 election entitled “How Would God Vote: Why the Bible Commands You to Be a Conservative,&quot; I knew it demanded rebutting. https://t.co/uVhzDvw0El&#10;&#10;So I put out a call for collaborators to rebut the book --- ideally, within 30 days after its release, since an election was coming up.&#10;https://t.co/83j34Z5LVz&#10;&#10;As it happened, only one person answered my call: Yori Yanover, my boss at the Jewish Communications Network (AKA https://t.co/thUparRLOP) at the dawn of the Web  and author of &quot;The Cabalist's Daughter: A Novel of Practical Messianic Redemption Paperback.&quot; https://t.co/t6ot6Q9xdl&#10;&#10;So we divided Klinghoffer's chapters and wrote our rebuttals as fast as we could. We didn't attack all of his arguments -- he supported reparations for African Americans, and gun control in a nod to contrarianism -- and time of course was a limiting factor. https://t.co/OcMuCTnAAy&#10;&#10;But we did go after his attacks on gay marriage, feminism, divorce, evolution, progressive taxation, and health care (not just government funded health care -- he suggested that all medical care is bad because it will decrease people's tendency to pray. Really!) https://t.co/U3Tz1dREc3&#10;&#10;And we went after his calls for capital punishment, the drug war, and the Iraq War. As we bloggers used to say back in those days, we gave him a good fisking -- and offered readers some laughs along the way. https://t.co/jPMIJqitUK&#10;&#10;Did the book have an impact? Well, it came out before the election, and Obama won the election. On the other hand, the book sold dozens rather than hundreds of copies. On the third hand, David Klinghoffer never opined on Jewish affairs again. So a win? https://t.co/4Lo7gnrRjk&#10;&#10;Meanwhile, if you want to read some pilpul justifying the progressive opinions on these issues, and pick up some deep background on the nature of the religious right that has installed the current #RogueSCOTUS -- well, it's free! What do you have to lose? https://t.co/EjHpOCIoPz&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TheDCSentinel So we can assume that showing such little ability to predict the future will hurt her career at the Atlantic? Or is her job not to be smart, but to tell comforting lies about Republicans?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@EladNehorai What might be worthwhile is reminding other Republicans that these are crazy fundamentalists who believe in literal demons and faith healing.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>What's the equivalent for &quot;The worst person in the world has made a good point,&quot; except it's &quot;The worst person in the world has had a Nazi quote he was attacking attributed to him and turned into a meme with his picture on it at https://t.co/IjIigsMuTj&quot;?&#10;&#10;And no, there's no contact form on the site or other way to ask them to correct it. And I (or the victim) couldn't in good faith sign a copyright takedown, since the actual quote belongs to a 1937 Nazi filmmaker ... at least according to said worst person's article.&#10;&#10;</description>
