			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah @yaeltime I think it’s a response to the Evangelical myth that Christianity was a bulwark against Naziism and is never an oppressor.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah @yaeltime See for example this critique of a Bonhoeffer biography, which argues that the Evangelical biographer distorted the anti-Nazi theologian to make him a good Christian by Southern Baptist standards. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/eDTBHMZeQA&quot;&gt;https://t.co/eDTBHMZeQA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Since I worry about this — it seems the FBI is actually good about returning your phone to you rather quickly if you don’t give them a hard time about cloning it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Nonetheless, I recently backed up key numbers so I can contact loved ones if I need to resort to a temporary phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Also, I make it a point not to conspire to commit federal crimes. Nobody else’s plan is worth even a day away from beloved iPhone 13 mini.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@yaeltime @ElishevaAvital Where it will be swallowed by a fish. Who will be caught by a fisherman and served as a Shabbos delicacy in Monsey. Wherein the smartphone will be discovered, turned on, and quickly corrupt a wonderful heimische family. Do you really want that on your conscience as YK approaches?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Glad to help. And offer my Twitter addiction as a cautionary tale.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Did you have screen time rules last year? Do the hours gradually increase as the child approaches age 21?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck If so, full abolition is unfair to both their past and future selves.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck Additionally, conflict and adversity builds character. Does your child want to be like the proverbial Tzaddik of Newark, who used to confuse the yetzer hara by giving in without a struggle but — crucially — was doomed to live in Newark?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trayne_wreck You could remind them that Roman children had no limitations on screen time but conversely could be sold not slavery by their parents. Is that what they want?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Let&amp;#39;s see. A quick google says His height is 236,000 parasangs, each being 3 miles. Roughly, that&amp;#39;s 600k miles to a 6&amp;#39; foot tall man, or a ratio of 100k X 5.286k or (again roughly) a scale of 500 million to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson A book cover is a roughly 2 decimeters, 200m nanometers. Which means one book cover&amp;#39;s worth of God&amp;#39;s Supernal Body is about half a nanometer of a human.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Which seems to be about five hydrogen atoms lined up, so presumably a moderately complex protein or two. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/lwhJ5WEt7u&quot;&gt;https://t.co/lwhJ5WEt7u&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Hmmm....&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
