			<description>@trekonomics What’s even the point of succeeding in a culture if the culture won’t stop changing? Wasn’t the point of graduating to finally put an end to the painful process of learning and  identity formation?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@BergYeshivaView @Doc_RPS @GettysburgNMP Certainly Samuel Clemens did some kind of tshuvah. My uncle did not. I would spit on a statue of a general, not on the grave of my uncle. But if you’d like to, apparently you can find him here. https://t.co/1lrMJOeQlD&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@BergYeshivaView @Doc_RPS @GettysburgNMP It was an evil cause and they were traitors. Was my great great great great uncle in a Confederate grave at Antietam a bad person? Probably not. But does he deserve a statue? Definitely not.&#10;&#10;@BergYeshivaView @Doc_RPS @GettysburgNMP And as you think about my ancestor’s brother, a recent immigrant to Georgia who benefited from an evil system of oppression and fought on its behalf, remind me again how you feel about the so-called “good” Germans who committed no murders and tortured nobody but simply stood by?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Shmarya @ShulimLeifer @naftalibennett And there’s a reason for that. And there’s a reason that the NYTimes is on the side of the NYPD and not that of the people they police. The cruelty, the oppression, is the point.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics Is it just dead cat bounce all the way out? Or is just an unwinding blending into the next recession, which means those of us who want to finally profit by launching and servicing a bubble should start figuring out a plausibly sounding Web 4.0 immediately?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Shmarya @ShulimLeifer @naftalibennett That’s right. It was a choice to have a police force. Just like it’s a choice to pay police to tear down homeless encampments and not pay builders to build them housing. Just like it’s a choice to not fight for covid aid.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Tzipshmil @nycsouthpaw @EliseStefanik Remember: Don’t say a bad word about her party. That doesn’t poll well. https://t.co/Yxj0lkC1kk&#10;&#10;@Tzipshmil @nycsouthpaw @EliseStefanik I expect future historians will discover that the Republic fell because high-priced Democratic consultants misread the cross tabs because they didn’t understand R and were too embarrassed to ask for help.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Religion serves as a good proof-of-concept for a business model of the psychological fact that people find an explanation persuasive regardless of its actual content. https://t.co/q2gTU0wrL3&#10;&#10;Classic psychological test: Students asked to cut in line at the university library copying machine. Their requests were significantly more granted if they offered this explanation: “because I have to make some copies.”&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@ShulimLeifer @AkivaMCohen I could imagine local police doing that to a BLM funeral. The job of a police is to pacify an underclass who one fears might fight against their oppressors.&#10;&#10;@ShulimLeifer @AkivaMCohen That’s why the suburban Long Islanders who Schumer sees as the decisive swing voter get paid four times my salary to criminally violate the rights of NYC protesters.&#10;&#10;@ShulimLeifer @AkivaMCohen That’s why the US judiciary has made getting justice from a police office as impossibly as getting justice from an IDF soldier who crossed a line.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Shmarya @naftalibennett Nah. Biden isn’t willing to stand up to fascists and their bipartisan funders abroad or at home. I believe that if this was indeed a police riot, it’s ultimately less evil, and inflicted less pain, and killed fewer people, than Biden’s call to divert covid relief to the police.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Well. This certainly sheds like on the decades-long series of halachic disputes between Rabbis Moshe Tendler and David Bleich. https://t.co/G6V1QLF0LS&#10;&#10;The joke used to be: How can you prove a cheeseburger is kosher? Well, we know Rabbi Tendler holds its treif. So obviously Rabbi Bleich holds its kosher.&#10;&#10;Incidentally, Rabbi Tendler was. Strong advocate of extralegal acts to save lives — something of relevance to newly reopened questions of abortion and the expected court rulings that will cripple the fight against climate change. https://t.co/t15qL6Uyqa&#10;&#10;Those of you interested in the intersection of moral philosophy and halacha will probably want to read the whole article; I’ll add a link in a little bit.&#10;&#10;</description>
