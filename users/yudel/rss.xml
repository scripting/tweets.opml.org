			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AlexandraErin @tompeyer There used to be such people. They fought government suppression of speech at the Supreme Court and, in the 60s and 70s, decisively won. I expect we’ll see such people again soon at the Supreme Court, decisively losing in the 20s and 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AlexandraErin @tompeyer Ms. Paul is making their work harder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@hollyrob19 @EladNehorai @AIPAC As an AIPAC supporter, can you explain why Israel needs explicit AIPAC funding rather than the less explicit funding through North Jersey’s own Norpac political action committee?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;Your reminder that the NYTimes pays people to produce right wing disinformation, which generally works by highlighting a minor situation to obscure a major situation. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/hfjKycGNm2&quot;&gt;https://t.co/hfjKycGNm2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that this works only because the NYTimes downplays right wing bad behavior. If Republican efforts in Virginia to sue book publishers and reverse decades of First Amendment law had been properly reported by the “paper of record,” the columnist couldn’t have ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;And yes, there is a book that @BenYehudaPress hopes to publish in the next year or two which may be illegal to sell in certain states by then, given the Republican Supreme Court’s pledged goal of returning the Constitution to its 18th or 19th century reading.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I’m willing to gamble the minuscule advance I pay my authors that the #RogueSCOTUS will be right-sized before it rules on these matters and obligates Amazon to restrict sales of the book in Red States.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But if I were paying real money — you better believe there’d be a chilling effect.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;But Ms. Paul’s job is not going explicitly not to tell you that Lolita and Origin of the Species could plausibly be banned in American states before the decade is over.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@JeffSharlet I wish there were some discussion of an off-ramp. A formal way for people to say, “I used to be a Republican, but I’m no longer aboard. I did not sign up sedition and banning birth control and putting gays back in the closet. For the conceivable future, I’m outta there”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@JeffSharlet Something I could give my kids to make the case to their grandfather. Who is really a much nicer person than the fascist politics he has drifted into quietly acceding to.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;One of the wonderful things of being of a certain age is that I have wonderful nostalgic childhood memories of typewriters which renew my deep appreciation for having moved past that technology. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/4bI8foGDOP&quot;&gt;https://t.co/4bI8foGDOP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Likewise with programming with punch cards, only more so. Much more so, because the Fun Thing about punchcards is that there was no backspace key or Witeout. Make a mistake and you have to retype the card (a line of code) from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@moorehn @Chronotope Another way to understand it is that the current editor of the Atlantic used to be a lead reporter for The Forward when it was run by WSJ vet Seth Lipsky, who let culture warrior neoconservatives act as assignment editors.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
