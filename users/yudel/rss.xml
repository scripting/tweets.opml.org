			<description>&lt;p&gt;@EladNehorai Also, the precise opposite of the truth of the past century of American Jewish history. “Jewish pride” manifested in the 70s after the decline and canceling of antisemitism in the previous two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@HangleyJr @joshtpm Of course, that frame raises a question uncomfortable for Team R: Should the FBI not protect classified defense secrets for fear of Republican lawlessness?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson As I see it, the “best” case for him is that he just petulantly packed up rather than file everything that crossed his desk after he lost the election. So these could be boxes of McDonald’s receipts. And the occasional notes on a PDB.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson Just his habitual law breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson Still a phenomenal hill for a party to die on.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson Worst case is actual sellable security secrets he had no need to access and evidence of crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@TomLevenson I certainly would want to see the FBI receipt before jumping to his defense…&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm This behavior points to big-time criming. But Trump’s Razor suggests that it’s all receipts for McDonalds takeout and similarly trivial records that he petulantly refused to file according to protocol (and law) after the election.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm Probably some colorful PDBs for Dummies and the like, but mostly just trivia, held on to for the sake of gratuitous rule-breaking.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@joshtpm So no smoking gun memos which could possibly be forged and planted; just ten boxes of junk, with the equivalent of pizza recipes and gefilte fish tariff negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@cstross My Orthodox Jewish group was sufficiently evangelical or even cultish that the Peoples Temple massacre was the subject of some very nervous jokes.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@cstross I recall a SNL sketch parodying the Dr Pepper commercials (“How would you like to be a Peppe?”) which similarly unnerved us.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@cstross Anyway, I share Heinlein’s faith that America will escape theocracy.
