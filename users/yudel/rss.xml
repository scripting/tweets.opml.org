			<description>@Ww3Real I think my grandfather, who spent WWII in some civilian economic planning capacity, would be interested in economic stats: productive workers, mineral resources, fuel supplies, etc. can’t really see how Europe can hold out absent access to high tech factories and supplies.&#10;&#10;@Ww3Real Where are they fabbing their chips and mining their cobalt?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@TheLincoln The State of the Union should honor American workers by seizing baseball from its taxpayer-subsidized billionaire owners and giving it to a player-owned cooperative.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@rabbijilljacobs @truahrabbis I kinda was for a year. Worked for a Jewish startup in 95 funded by an Israeli who had made a small fortune as the US agent of a Russian who was making a large fortune by being given a “privatized” aluminum mine that had previously belonged to the state at fire sale prices.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@froomkin “I can't speak to the specifics of, you know, whether they have aircraft flying over it and what they're doing.” — if it’s a mixture of satellite coverage, long range radar, reliable Ukrainian reports, and penetration of Russian coms, it might be better not to show all the cards.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>But he won’t, because he’s convinced himself that he can sit out the culture wars in hopes of gaining the mythical moderate voter. https://t.co/BsiMKLGO26&#10;&#10;It’s proving to be a successful way to drive his voters to despair, because it functionally denies the obvious fact that the Republican Party and their rogue courts have gone completely radical.&#10;&#10;Moderation in the face of extremism, to paraphrase a famously election losing candidate, is no virtue.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@456meepmoop @jayrosen_nyu @TheAtlantic There a limit to how anti-Republican the Atlantic can allow itself to be, lest it become “partisan.” Which is bad for business.&#10;&#10;@456meepmoop @jayrosen_nyu @TheAtlantic I still remember the frightening story they ran by William Calvin 30+ years ago on the frightening possibility that global warming might shut down the Gulf Stream. Have they run anything noteworthy on climate change since climate denial became a central Republican policy?&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics I suspect that Putin — and his generation of Soviets — were strongly miseducated as to how the Bolsheviks were able to rule Ukraine with little pushback in the 20th century.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@JosieBrendaA @JewWhoHasItAll @JewishConnectiv The latter being an undercelebrated holiday that deserves to be commercialized. I notice that this year it falls on Flag Day, which one assumes is Xian Simchas Torah. Great crossover potential there.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics We all grow up with pre-enlightenment values, assuming the world we see as children is how it must be. Learning otherwise requires a combination of good education, good community, good politics, and good therapy.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics I remember being disturbed that my mom and my best friend’s mom — the two of them best friends themselves — had differing policies n whether one should play in the yard barefoot or with socks.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics Not unrelated to the debate among 17th century rabbis as to whether one should light Hanukkah candles from right to left or vice versa — with the unexamined assumption that there was a right way and a wrong way.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@trekonomics Makes sense. It’s a deeply personal dissent from cultural norms. “Free to be you and me” is not a message authoritarians like.&#10;&#10;@trekonomics Luckily, Christian authoritarians haven’t defended taking Jewish children from their homes in the name of their cultural norms since, um, 2018. https://t.co/yLG64bRQHn&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Lexaphus I’m just curious as to what was the breaking point for someone in the year of their Lord 2020. Speaking as someone who has been criticizing the institution from within and without since at least 1984.&#10;&#10;</description>
