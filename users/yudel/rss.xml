			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bogiperson Let&amp;#39;s see. A quick google says His height is 236,000 parasangs, each being 3 miles. Roughly, that&amp;#39;s 600k miles to a 6&amp;#39; foot tall man, or a ratio of 100k X 5.286k or (again roughly) a scale of 500 million to 1.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah To be fair to YU, I felt the same as a straight student back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@MisfitTorah One of the most important lessons I learned at Yeshiva College is that Institutions act neither for the good of the ostensible human constituents, or toward their stated values, but for their self preservation and aggrandizement. An important but painful lesson.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@bernstein_judah Yes. Cf Gary Rosenblatt’s Substack post lamenting that Jewish organizations didn’t back up @yaffedorg’s complaint. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/dYtXvziBZf&quot;&gt;https://t.co/dYtXvziBZf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@bernstein_judah @yaffedorg Incidentally, if I had to pick a closing date for a study of American Jewry that begins in June 1967, it would end with Gary stepping down from the Jewish Week.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@protecttruth_ @joshtpm @AJentleson But if the Democrats vote to let it go through, it would require Republicans to filibuster an abortion bill — which would come back to haunt them in primaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@WinterlightHome There are probably a couple small schools in those towns with similar educational neglect, but nothing massive on the scale of the Satmar system in NY — and bringing in that kind of state aid.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@WinterlightHome Chabadniks will send their kids to a community day school, but if there is a critical mass will start their own cheder.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@DemocraticLuntz So you&amp;#39;re saying he hates when that happens?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DemocraticLuntz I just casually assumed that his hell is being sentenced to be the videographer in someone else&amp;#39;s sex-crazed heaven.

			<description>&lt;p&gt;“It is entirely possible for yeshivas to offer enriching English, math, and science education at the same time as a strong grounding in religious texts and Jewish tradition – indeed, many do.” &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/XlTxV90ySS&quot;&gt;https://t.co/XlTxV90ySS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;“I know it personally, because many of my friends and colleagues are smart, well-educated yeshiva graduates.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Nice to see the seamless spectrum of Orthodoxy being used against the right, for a change.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;On the organizational level, Agudah has Satmar’s back. The OU seems to have been conspicuously silent.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Note that Lander is a city-wide elected official, so his constituents include Orthodox Jews who resent the implicit (and sometimes explicit) chassidic claim that they’re G-d-forsaking goyim for educating their children in English and math.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper If America’s Mayor has been paying attention, a kosher meal order wouldn’t necessary disqualify a lawyer from being an observant Muslim. Considering kosher meat to be halal is a mainstream shariah position.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper He’d be taking a gamble that no wine or alcohol was used in the cooking, but probably not an unreasonable gamble.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper Pretty sure that Mukasey is an observant Jew.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@DreadMuller @samstein @jaketapper The “anti-Shariah Law” movement radicalized knowledgable Orthodox Jews against islamophobia, because Shariah plays an identical role in American jurisprudence as does Jewish Halacha. As it pretty much does in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
