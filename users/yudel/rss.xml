			<description>@sevensixfive If God had wanted us to see the Columbian Exhibition, he would have had us be born in the 19th century. As was my great grandmother, who found the San Francisco earthquake more memorable than the subsequent exhibition.&#10;&#10;@sevensixfive Since the earthquake likely contributed to her subsequent miscarriage, and thereby to the birth of my grandmother two years later, I ask that time travelers not interfere with early 20th century Californian plate tectonics.&#10;&#10;@sevensixfive Thank you. https://t.co/u6sIYbg1VA&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>Sad to see kids smoking away their childhood, which should have been filled with toys. Like lead dreidels. https://t.co/YSwGi1KZHp&#10;&#10;I first discovered lead dreidels when reading about the founding of the Ktav publishing house, which grew out of a Lower East Side lead dreidel business.&#10;&#10;JTA recently wrote about Arthur Kurzweil’s dreidel collection. Some are pewter. https://t.co/KxYEZhUXD3&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@AvBronstein Let me try a contrarian take. DSM defines mental disorders in large part by their interference with daily functioning. ADA requires that accommodation be given to holders of a DSM diagnosis. The result is a bureaucratic accommodation of extreme grief — which is a good thing.&#10;&#10;@AvBronstein And perhaps the best that can be asked for in a bureaucratic society.&#10;&#10;@AvBronstein Needless to say, that’s not the approach taken by the books I’ve published on the topic. https://t.co/cyk7l0Gt7F&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@bernstein_judah I have seen no reports of any actual investigation of the chain of causality that leads to anti Asian hatred and from that bigotry to criminal attacks.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@christapeterso Rho might have discovered the counter on his own, as my Trooper did. Where he discovered a love for bread.&#10;&#10;@christapeterso It was a live that transcended the plastic bags the bread came in. It was a love that transcended the bread box I bought to protect the bread from Trooper.&#10;&#10;@christapeterso It was a love that figured out how to open the refrigerator when I began storing the bread there.&#10;&#10;@christapeterso Fortunately, even Trooper’s love for bread could not transcend the wooden refrigerator guard my father built in his workshop. Which also cut down on my own refrigerator browsing.&#10;&#10;@christapeterso Trooper’s counter explorations then led him to discover the joy of tomatoes. Which led me to discover the pros and cons of refrigerating tomatoes.&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@onthemainline One Seder I offered four explanations for the orange on our plate. One was a Zionist reference to Jaffa oranges. One was this historically accurate explanation. One drew on Tu b’shvat klipa ideas. Can’t remember the fourth at the moment. Maybe a glass of wine would help…&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@byJudeDoyle Data point: There was an antisemitic attack on a local doctor’s office in my very Jewish town not long ago seemingly motivated by these conspiracy theories. https://t.co/JeRPmpfFkT&#10;&#10;</description>

			<description>@Yair_Rosenberg I think you underestimate the challenges involved in asking her “at the outset to account for her anti-Semitic utterances. These questions should be posed in specific and concrete terms, making explicit reference to the ugly ideas she has written and recommended.”&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg I would imagine that she has retyped more (out of context) Talmud citations than most newspaper culture reporters have ever read.&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg Do you quote and then call @FoxmanAbraham for a rebuttal? And now you’ve both-sided the Protocols.&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg @FoxmanAbraham Do you simply say, Walker, who holds bizarre antisemitic conspiracy theories, as an appositive clause as if it were an honorary degree or a lingering illness?&#10;&#10;@Yair_Rosenberg @FoxmanAbraham The journalistic conventions of approaching every main character with a presumption of good faith makes de facto cancellation the easiest course for a reporter and editor for whom an Alice Walker appearance is supposed to be an easy story.&#10;&#10;</description>
