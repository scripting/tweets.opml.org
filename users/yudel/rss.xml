			<description>&lt;p&gt;Hmmm. I suspect a lot of folks in the Army had access to classified materials — and strong training in their proper handling. Interesting that there are lots of ex-military Democrats holding seats in purple congressional districts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qupSLAfKEH&quot;&gt;https://t.co/qupSLAfKEH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Take Mikie Sherill, in NJ’s 11th. I know nothing about her beyond what I just read on Wikipedia. But I would guess her military roles outlined there involved classified data.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Her Republican opponent is a lawyer and ex-prosecutor. What is his position on mishandling classified information? Seems like a useful wedge issue for a Democrat in that race.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AvBronstein @MisfitTorah Obviously, YU’s board of directors does not have a great track record with even medium term forecasting, but personally I wouldn’t trade northern Manhattan real estate for Florida. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/upQc56BKRw&quot;&gt;https://t.co/upQc56BKRw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AD_Lobel Sea of Talmud indeed.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AD_Lobel I will say my efforts to summon leprechauns studying Torah were not quite successful.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@DavidAstinWalsh It is totally possible that TFG received information to that effect in a classified PDB and had no idea that &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; bit of info was public knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;I confess: I did not have “Lakewood cuts down trees in act of sodomy” on my 2022 chilul Hashem bingo card. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/9V0lIrqbJa&quot;&gt;https://t.co/9V0lIrqbJa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Now, I don’t know how much direct influence the Lakewood yeshiva community has on the town council. But clearly, Jewish values concerning both the poor and trees failed to manifest beyond the walls of the yeshiva — if they are even present there.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, if you want proper Talmudic wisdom on the situation, I again recommend Justice in the City by @IrMiklat   &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/VkqWjP2oYX&quot;&gt;https://t.co/VkqWjP2oYX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;I am informed from a frum source closer to Lakewood than I am that  “This was an internal decision with some input from some local businesses, primarily Hispanic. I haven&amp;#39;t heard from anyone yet here that was supportive of this move.”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@Ah_Pook_Is_Here @YourVote2022 @TristanSnell Right. It’s not his call whether to indict — but it would be irresponsible at this point for Garland not to give him (and the FBI) a heads-up.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
