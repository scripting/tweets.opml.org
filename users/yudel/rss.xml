			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Actually, this opens an avenue for a Second Amendment defense.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics How can one criminalize information useful in properly arming one’s militia?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics My current theory is that after losing the election, he petulantly refused to put anything in the “to archive” box and just took it up his quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Simply a spoiled kid without a law-abiding bone in his body.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics And then when he was caught he kept playing the same game.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Not that dissimilar to forcing subcontractors to sue for payment.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Given that he doesn’t read the documents, he might have had no idea what was in them. And no curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Add an abiding resentment that Hillary “got away with” acid washing emails, why should he listen to some silly lawyer telling him what to do?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics Credit for this idea goes to @joshtpm’s “Trump’s Razor” and asking, “what’s the stupidest possibility for what’s going on?”&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics We’ll try to stay serene and calm / when Mar-a-Lago gets the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@trekonomics I still believe this was general lawlessness and criminality not an effort to sell secrets. Foreign governments are traditionally willing to accept nuclear secrets in photographic reproduction.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@BarSiegal @CambridgeUP Does it stand alone or is it like the Empire Strikes Back totally a sequel?&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@BarSiegal @CambridgeUP I took my chances and bought it regardless. I do hope book three features dancing Talmudic teddy bears.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In case you were wondering how Maga land is responding to Garland: The Post Millenial sent our four tweets, highlighting Garland’s not taking questions, none mentioning the request to unseal the warrant. Ben Shapiro retweeted a similar clip emphasizing not taking questions. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/vXQuNE97VD&quot;&gt;https://t.co/vXQuNE97VD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@AkivaMCohen Also, the warrant and receipt is damning. Though I’m inclined to believe that TFG may have just held on to documents out of sheer stupid criminal insolence, rather than to obstruct justice or commit espionage.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AkivaMCohen However, given that lazy violation of secrecy statutes has been a major political issue in recent years….&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@AkivaMCohen My theory is based on “Trump’s Razor”: it’s always the stupidest explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;@froomkin Thinking about @joshtpm’s “Trump’s Razor”: that it’s always the stupidest explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@froomkin @joshtpm I’m imagining TFG petulantly refusing to properly file anything that crossed his desk after the election, instead stashing it in his quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@froomkin @joshtpm The result is 25 boxes of stolen government files, some of them top secret,  some of those seriously important military information, but all stolen simply out of a lifelong aversion to following rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@froomkin @joshtpm Similarly, the ten boxes taken back by the FBI this week weren’t particularly more valuable than those returned, but just kept out of a general principle of not following rules.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@froomkin @joshtpm Not part of an effort to cover up 1/6, not part of an effort to sell secrets to foreign powers, but just pure stupid criminality.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;&lt;p&gt;@froomkin @joshtpm So far I think this theory matches what evidence we have.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;</description>
