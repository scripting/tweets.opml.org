				<outline text="@annaems00 @beestang61 @SenSherrodBrown @ByGeorgeThomas TN v. Garner doesn't justify shooting a fleeing suspect 60 times. Since they initially attempted to tase him, it seems they didn't view him as a serious threat which negates one of the disjuncts in Garner. Fleeing through an empty field also isn't a threat to public safety." rawText="@annaems00 @beestang61 @SenSherrodBrown @ByGeorgeThomas TN v.
