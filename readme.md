# tweets.opml.org

A directory of tweets.opml files for people using tweets.opml.org.

### Background

For people who were part of the initial Drummer test group this will be familiar. It was initially developed inside Drummer, but I figured out that it would work better if it ran on a server, so I punted on the feature, to get back to it after the product shipped.

Here was the initial <a href="http://scripting.com/drummer/blog/2021/09/19/164624.html?title=newFeatureTweetsopml">announcement</a>. 

### Who needs this?

If you write in an outliner, and use Twitter, now you can have all your original tweets (not RTs) in a calendar-structured outline, that updates on its own. 

This means if you're out and about and get an idea you want to include in your writing, just write a tweet, and when you get back it'll be in Drummer.

### Is it just for Drummer?

No. It's for anyone with an OPML-compatible outliner, which for now effectively means Drummer. But I want to this to be open to all, the same way RSS feeds are open to all. You didn't have to use Radio UserLand to read feeds when RSS was booting up, and the same thing is true of OPML today.

### How to

Here's how to get started...

On twitter.com make sure you're logged into the Twitter account you want to use for this. 

Go to <a href="http://tweets.opml.org/">tweets.opml.org</a> and sign in. 

Post something to Twitter to get things started. Wait a few minutes. 

On the home page there will be a link to your OPML file, grab the link, switch into Drummer and enter the address into the <i>Open URL</i> command in the File menu.

That's all you have to do to set it up.

Next time you tweet, after as much as three minutes (that's the interval between checks, it may go up over time as more people use the service) the tweet should show up in the outline on GitHub, and in Drummer. 

### Questions/suggestions

There are still a few things I want to add to this, but the service is fairly complete. I think it works. But in case it doesn't or if you just want to ask questions about the design, or what it can be used for, I started a <a href="https://github.com/scripting/drummerSupport/issues/130">thread</a> on the Support site. 

Hope you like it!
