# tweets.opml.org

A free <a href="http://tweets.opml.org/">service</a> that keeps an archive of your tweets in machine-readable form on GitHub. 

You don't have to install any software. It's all done on my server, which I'm running as part of a bootstrap. 

You can help by signing up.

### Getting started

On twitter.com make sure you're logged into the Twitter account you want to use for this service. 

Go to <a href="http://tweets.opml.org/">tweets.opml.org</a> and sign up. The app will periodically read your tweets and update your outline. 

You can also view your tweets as an outline there, and share a link to your outline of tweets with other people. They don't have to be signed in to see your tweets in an outline form. 

### What's here

The <a href="https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users">users folder</a> contains the tweets of all the registered users. 

For example, <a href="https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users/davewiner">here's my folder</a>. 

Under each user are archive folders, one for each year, so far <a href="https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users/davewiner/2021">2021</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/tree/main/users/davewiner/2022">2022</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scripting/tweets.opml.org/blob/main/users/davewiner/2022/02.opml">tweets.opml</a> which contains this month's tweets in a calendar-structured outline. 

### Where this is going

The goal of the bootstrap:  Your tweets flowing through any outliner.  

And from there where ever they go.  

Public documents and private ones.   

To make Twitter a useful tool for ideation and organization. 

Individual projects and group projects.  

And of course publishing.

We never had a connector like Twitter in the early days of outlining. I wanted it. Desperately. Now we have it.

I wrote this section in Twitter as a thread, added it to the source of my GitHub page, all edited in my outliner. It's a new level of integration. And it's not limited to any outliner, they can all hook into this network. They should and as users, you can influence them to do so.

### My product is interop

<a href="http://scripting.com/2021/12/16/153331.html?title=myProductIsInterop">I really mean it</a>. The software I make is targeted to one goal, to build interop between people who use outliners. No walls. We need the full power of human intellect, not harnessed to Silicon Valley business models. The really is a philosophy to this work, and when you participate, you're helping the bootstrap, and helping build the intellectual power of the web.
